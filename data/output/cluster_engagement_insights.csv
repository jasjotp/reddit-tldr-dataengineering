I am reviewing for interviews and the following question come to mind.

If **surrogate keys** are supposed to be unique identifiers that don't have real world meaning AND if **primary keys** are supposed to reliably identify and distinguish between each individual record (which also don't have real world meaning), then why will someone use a surrogate key? Wouldn't using primary keys be the same? Is there any case in which surrogate keys are the way to go?

P.S: Both surrogate and primary keys are auto generated by DB. Right?

P.S.1: I understand that a surrogate key doesn't necessarily have to be the a primary key, so considering that both have no real meaning outside the DB, then I wonder what the purpose of surrogate keys are.

P.S.2: At work (in different projects), we mainly use natural keys for analytical workloads and primary keys for uniquely identifying a given row. So I am wondering on which kind of cases/projects these surrogate keys will fit.
