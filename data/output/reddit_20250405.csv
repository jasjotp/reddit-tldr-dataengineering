1jr15ej,What's the non-technical biggest barrier you face at work?,"What’s currently challenging for me is getting access to things.

I design a data pipeline, present it to the team that will benefit from it, and everyone gets super excited.

Then I reach out to the internal department or an external party to either grant me admin access to the platform I need, or to help me obtain an API.

A week goes by—nothing. I follow up via email. Eventually, someone replies and says it's not possible to give me admin credentials. Fine. So I ask, “Can you help me get the API instead? It’s very straightforward.”

Another week goes by—still nothing. I send another follow-up…

Now the other person is kind of frustrated (because I’m asking them to do something slightly different, even though I’m offering guidance).

What follows is just a back-and-forth with long, frustrating waiting periods in between. Meanwhile, the team I presented the pipeline or project to starts getting frustrated with me and probably thinks I’m full of crap.

Once I finally get the damn API or whatever access I needed, I complete the project in 1–2 days but delayed by weeks or even months.

1jr68kn,Are Hyperscalers becoming more expensive in Europe due to the tariffs?,"Hi,

With the recent tariffs in mind, are cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud becoming more expensive for European companies? And what about other techs like Snowflake or Databricks – are they affected too?

Would it be wise for European businesses to consider open-source alternatives, both for cost and strategic independence?

And from a personal perspective: should we, as employees, expand our skill sets toward open-source tech stacks to stay future-proof?",30,26,Ok-Inspection3886,2025-04-04 07:31:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jr68kn/are_hyperscalers_becoming_more_expensive_in/,0,False,False,False,False

1jr3z1u,Faster way to view + debug data,"Hi r/dataengineering!

  
I wanted to share a project that I have been working on. It's an intuitive data editor where you can interact with local and remote data (e.g. Athena & BigQuery). For several important tasks, it can speed you up by 10x or more. (see website for more)

  
For data engineering specifically, this would be really useful in debugging pipelines, cleaning local or remote data, and being able to easy create new tables within data warehouses etc.

I know this could be a lot faster than having to type everything out, especially if you're just poking around. I personally find myself using this before trying any manual work.

Also, for those doing complex queries, you can split them up and work with the frame visually and add queries when needed. Super useful for when you want to iteratively build an analysis or new frame ***without writing a super long query.***

  
As for data size, it can handle local data up to around 1B rows, and remote data is only limited by your data warehouse.

  
You don't have to migrate *anything* either.

  
If you're interested, you can check it out here: [https://www.cocoalemana.com](https://www.cocoalemana.com)

  
I'd love to hear about your workflow, and see what we can change to make it cover more data engineering use cases.

  
Cheers!

1jr23mk,How do I get out of this rut,"I’m currently about the finish an early career rotational program with a top 10 bank. The rotation I am currently on and where the company is placing me post program (I tried to get placed somewhere else) is as a data engineer on a data delivery team. When I was advertised this rotation and the team I was told pretty specifically we would be using all the relevant technologies and I would be very hands on keyboard building pipelines with python , configuring cloud services and snowflake, being a part of data modeling. Mind you I’m not completely new I have experience with all this in personal projects and previous work experience as a SWE and researcher in college. 

Turns out all of that was a lie. I later learned there is an army of contractors that do the actual work. I was stuck with analyzing .egp files and other SAS files documenting it and handing off to consultants to rebuild in Talend to ingest into snowflake. The only tech that I use is Visio and Word.

I coped with that by saying after I’m out of the program I’ll get to do the actual work. But I had a conversation with my manager today about what my role will be post program. He basically said there are a lot more of these SAS procedures they are porting over to talend and snowflake and I’ll be documenting them and handing over to contractors so they can implement the new process. Honestly that is all really quick and easy to do because there isn’t that much complicated business logic for the LOBs we support just joins and the occasional aggregation so most days I’m not doing anything.

When I told him I would really like to be involved in the technical work or the data modeling , he said that is not my job anymore and that is what we pay the contractors to do so I can’t do it. Almost made it seem like I should be grateful and he is doing me a favor somehow.

It just feels like I was misled or even outright lied to about the position. We don’t use any of the technologies that were advertised (Drag and drop/low code tools seem like fake engineering), I don’t get to be hands on keyboard at all. Just seems like there really I no growth or opportunity in this role. I would leave but I took relocation and a signing bonus for this and if I leave too early I owe it back. I also can’t internally transfer anywhere for a year after starting my new role.

I guess my rant is just to ask what should I be doing in this situation? I work on personal projects and open source and I have gotten a few certs in the downtime at work but I don’t know if it’s enough to make sure my skills don’t atrophy while I wait out my repayment period. I consider myself a somewhat technical guy but I have been boxed into a non technical role.

1jramqt,"Airbyte Connector Builder now supports GraphQL, Async Requests and Custom Components","Hello, Marcos from the Airbyte Team.

For those who may not be familiar, Airbyte is an open-source data integration (EL) platform with over 500 connectors for APIs, databases, and file storage.

In our last release we added several new features to our no-code Connector Builder:

* [GraphQL Support](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/request-options#graphql-request-injection): In addition to REST, you can now make requests to GraphQL APIs (and properly handle pagination!)
* [Async Data Requests](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/connector-builder-ui/async-streams): There are some reporting APIs that do not return responses immediately. For instance, with Google Ads.  You can now request a custom report from these sources and wait for the report to be processed and downloaded.
* [Custom Python Code Components](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/connector-builder-ui/custom-components): We recognize that some APIs behave uniquely—for example, by returning records as key-value pairs instead of arrays or by not ordering data correctly. To address these cases, our open-source platform now supports custom Python components that extend the capabilities of the no-code framework without blocking you from building your connector.

We believe these updates will make connector development faster and more accessible, helping you get the most out of your data integration projects.

We understand there are discussions about the trade-offs between no-code and low-code solutions. At Airbyte, transitioning from fully coded connectors to a low-code approach allowed us to maintain a large connector catalog using standard components.  We were also able to create a better build and test process directly in the UI. Users frequently give us the feedback that the no-code connector Builder enables less technical users to create and ship connectors. This reduces the workload on senior data engineers allowing them to focus on critical data pipelines.

Something else that has been top of mind is speed and performance. With a robust and stable connector framework, the engineering team has been dedicating significant resources to introduce concurrency to enhance sync speed. You can read this[ blog post](https://airbyte.com/blog/improving-connector-sync-speed-up-to-10x-faster) about how the team implemented concurrency in the Klaviyo connector, resulting in a speed increase of about 10x for syncs.

I hope you like the news! Let me know if you want to discuss any missing features or provide feedback about Airbyte.",3,2,marcos_airbyte,2025-04-04 12:26:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jramqt/airbyte_connector_builder_now_supports_graphql/,0,False,False,False,False
1jrm80y,Marketing Report & Fivetran,"Fishing for advice as I'm sure many have been here before. I came from DE at a SaaS company where I was more focused on the infra but now I'm in a role much close to the business and currently working with marketing. I'm sure this could make the Top-5 all time repeated DE tasks. A daily marketing report showing metrics like Spend, cost-per-click, engagement rate, cost-add-to-cart, cost-per-traffic... etc. These are per campaign based on various data sources like GA4, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, TikTok etc. Data updates once a day.

It should be obvious I'm not writing API connectors for a dozen different services. I'm just one person doing this and have many other things to do. I have Fivetran up and running getting the data I need but MY GOD is it ever expensive for something that seems like it should be simple, infrequent & low volume. It comes with a ton of build in reports that I don't even need sucking rows and bloating the bill. I can't seem to get what I need without pulling millions of event rows which costs a fortune to do.

Are there other similar but (way) cheaper solutions are out there? I know of others but any recommendations for this specific purpose?",2,5,bcsamsquanch,2025-04-04 20:45:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jrm80y/marketing_report_fivetran/,0,False,False,False,False
1jrd8po,PII Obfuscation in Databricks,"Hi Data Champs,

I have been recently given chance to explore PII obfuscation technique in databricks.

I proposed using sql aes_encryption or python fernet for PII column level encryption before landing to bronze.

And use column masking on delta tables which has built in logic for group membership check and decryption so to avoid the overhead of a new view per table.

My HDE was more interested in sql approach than the fernet but fernet offers built in key rotation out of the box.

Has anyone used aes_encryption 
Is it secure, easy to work with and relatively more robust.

From my experience for data type other than binary like long, int, double it needs to be first converted to binary (don’t like it)

Apart from that usual error here and there for padding and generic error when decrypting sometimes.

So given the choice what will be your architecture

1jrc62b,Can you call an aimless star schema a data mart?,"So,

  
as always that's for the insight from other people, I find a lot of these discussions around points very entertaining and very helpful!

I'm having an argument with someone who is several levels above me. This might sound petty so I apologise in advance. It centres around the definition of a Mart. Our Mart is a single Fact with around 20 dimensions. The Fact is extremely wide and deep. Indeed we usually put it into a de normalised table for reporting. To me this isn't a MART as it isn't based on requirements but rather a star schema that supposedly servers multiple purposed or potential purposes. When engaged on requirements the person leans on there experience in the domain and says a user probable wants to do X, Y and Z. I've never seen anything written down. Constantly that report also defers to Kimball methodology and how this follows them closely. My take on the book is that these things need to be based of requirement, business requirements. 

My questions is, is it fair to say that a data mart needs to have requirements and ideally a business domain in mind or else its just a star schema?

Yes this  is  very theoretical... yes I probable need a hobby but look there hasn't been a decent RTS game in years and its friday!!!

When they came to us, their situation was rough. Dashboards taking forever to load, some poor analyst manually combining data from 5 different sources, and their CEO breathing down everyone's neck for daily conversion reports. Classic spreadsheet hell that we've all seen before.

We spent about two weeks redesigning their entire data architecture. Built them a proper [**data warehouse solution** ](https://datafortune.com/services/enterprise-data-management/data-warehouse/)with automated ETL pipelines that consolidated everything into one central location. Created some logical data models and connected it all to their existing BI tools.

The transformation was honestly pretty incredible to watch. Reports that used to take hours now run in seconds. Their analyst actually took a vacation for the first time in a year. And we got this really nice email from their CTO saying we'd ""changed how they make decisions"" which gave us all the warm fuzzies.
