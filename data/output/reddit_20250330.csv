1jmsyfl,SQLFlow: DuckDB for Streaming Data,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

**The goal of SQLFlow is to bring the simplicity of DuckDB to streaming data.**

SQLFlow is a high-performance stream processing engine that simplifies building data pipelines by enabling you to define them using just SQL. Think of SQLFLow as a lightweight, modern Flink.

SQLFlow models stream-processing as SQL queries using the [DuckDB SQL dialect](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/introduction.html). Express your entire stream processing pipeline—ingestion, transformation, and enrichment—as a single SQL statement and configuration file.

Process [10's of thousands of events per second](https://sql-flow.com/docs/tutorials/clickhouse-sink) on a single machine with low memory overhead, using Python, DuckDB, Arrow and Confluent Python Client.

Tap into the DuckDB ecosystem of tools and libraries to build your stream processing applications. SQLFlow supports [parquet](https://sql-flow.com/docs/tutorials/s3-parquet-sink), csv, json and [iceberg](https://sql-flow.com/docs/tutorials/iceberg-sink).

1jmsfs6,Interactive Change Data Capture (CDC) Playground,"I've built an interactive demo for CDC to help explain how it works.

The app currently shows the transaction log-based and query-based CDC approaches.

Change Data Capture (CDC) is a design pattern that tracks changes (inserts, updates, deletes) in a database and makes those changes available to downstream systems in real-time or near real-time.

CDC is super useful for a variety of use cases:

\- Real-time data replication between operational databases and data warehouses or lakehouses

\- Keeping analytics systems up to date without full batch reloads

\- Synchronizing data across microservices or distributed systems

\- Feeding event-driven architectures by turning database changes into event streams

\- Maintaining materialized views or derived tables with fresh data

\- Simplifying ETL/ELT pipelines by processing only changed records

And many more!

Let me know what you think and if there's any functionality missing that could be interesting to showcase.",51,4,dan_the_lion,2025-03-29 18:12:13,https://www.change-data-capture.com/,0,False,False,False,False
1jnc3zk,When to use a surrogate key instead of a primary key?,"Hi all!

I am reviewing for interviews and the following question come to mind.

If **surrogate keys** are supposed to be unique identifiers that don't have real world meaning AND if **primary keys** are supposed to reliably identify and distinguish between each individual record (which also don't have real world meaning), then why will someone use a surrogate key? Wouldn't using primary keys be the same? Is there any case in which surrogate keys are the way to go?

P.S: Both surrogate and primary keys are auto generated by DB. Right?

P.S.1: I understand that a surrogate key doesn't necessarily have to be the a primary key, so considering that both have no real meaning outside the DB, then I wonder what the purpose of surrogate keys are.

P.S.2: At work (in different projects), we mainly use natural keys for analytical workloads and primary keys for uniquely identifying a given row. So I am wondering on which kind of cases/projects these surrogate keys will fit.

1jnh7pu,A dbt column lineage visualization tool (with dynamic web visualization),"Hey dbt folks,

I'm a data engineer and use dbt on a day-to-day basis, my team and I were struggling to find a good open-source tool for user-friendly column-level lineage visualization that we could use daily, similar to what commercial solutions like dbt Cloud offer. So, I decided to start building one...

https://reddit.com/link/1jnh7pu/video/wcl9lru6zure1/player

You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/Fszta/dbt-column-lineage), and the package on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/dbt-col-lineage/0.1.1/)

**Under the hood**

Basically, it works by combining dbt's manifest and catalog with some compiled SQL parsing magic (big shoutout to sqlglot!).

I've built it as a CLI, keeping the syntax similar to dbt-core, with upstream and downstream selectors.

    dbt-col-lineage --select stg_transactions.amount+ --format html

Right now, it supports:

* Interactive HTML visualizations
* DOT graph images
* Simple text output in the console

**What's next ?**

* Focus on compatibility with more SQL dialects
* Improve the parser to handle complex syntax specific to certain dialects
* Making the UI less... basic. It's kinda rough right now, plus some information could be added such as materialization type, col typing etc

Feel free to drop any feedback or open an issue on the [repo](https://github.com/Fszta/dbt-column-lineage/tree/main)! It's still super early, and any help for testing on other dialects would be awesome. It's only been tested on projects using Snowflake, DuckDB, and SQLite adapters so far.",5,0,Eastern-Ad-6431,2025-03-30 17:11:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jnh7pu/a_dbt_column_lineage_visualization_tool_with/,0,False,2025-03-30 17:15:59,False,False

1jni0xm,Transitioning from DE to ML Engineer in 2025?,"I am a DE with 2 years of experience, but my background is mainly in statistics. I have been offered a position as an ML Engineer (de facto Data Scientist, but also working on deployment - it is a smaller IT department, so my scope of duties will be simply quite wide). 

The position is interesting, and there are multiple pros and cons to it (that I do not want to discuss in this post). However my question is a bit more general - in 2025, with all the LLMs performing quite well with code generation and fixing, which path would you say is more stable long-term - sticking to DE and becoming better and better at it, or moving more towards ML and doing data science projects?

Furthermore, I also wonder about growth in each field - in ML/DS, my fear is that I am not PhD nor excellent mathematician. In DE, on the other hand, my fear is lack of my solid CS/SWE foundations (as my background is more in statistics). 

Ultimately, it is just an honest question, as I am very curious of your perspective on the matter - does moving towards data science projects (XGBoost and other algorithms) in 2025 from DE (PySpark and Airflow) makes sense in 2025? Which path would you say is more reasonable, and what kind of growth I can expect for each position? Personally I am a bit reluctant to switch simply since I have already dedicated 2 years to growing as an DE, but on the other hand I also see how much more and more of my tasks can be automated.

1jnhk94,how to deal with azure vm nightmare?,"i am building data pipelines. i use azure vms for experimentation on sample data. when im not using them, i need to shut them off (working at bootstrapped startup).

when restarting my vm, it randomly fails. it says an allocation failure occurred due to capacity in the region (usually us-east). the only solution ive found is moving the resource to a new region, which takes 30–60 mins.

how do i prevent this issue in a cost-effective manner? can azure just allocate my vm to whatever region is available?

i’ve tried to troubleshoot this issue for weeks with azure support, but to no avail.

1jndfr9,Building a Cloud-Based Data Pipeline for Personal Use/Learning/Projects,"I am a data/functional analyst looking to get a better grasp on 'end-to-end data management and processing' (in quotations as that's the term my direct lead used when we aligned regarding my career objectives for the year, which definitely matches with my current interests).

Given this objective, my own interest in gaining a better grasp on general principles and functions of Data Engineering (and later on, Data Science), as well as a personal project I'm looking to finish for myself/my own portfolio by the end of the year, I'm looking for a cloud-based data pipeline solution for me to spend my role's training stipend on -- though I'm willing (and allowed) to use some of my personal funds on this as well since it's both for career progression and personal fun.

I started looking for small-scale subscriptions for some of the platforms we've previously used at work (AWS, Databricks), but the consensus I've gotten is that cost-wise, I'm potentially better off with multiple smaller platforms that I can just weave together, instead of going for platforms normally designed for enterprise use. And so I come here for help!

*(Though if this is not the right community for me to ask this, please let me know where instead)*

# Budget and Scope

* Base budget is a $200 stipend from our department, which refreshes at the end of the year
* I'm willing to add another $200-300/year, if necessary
* I'm from South-East Asia (converting our local currency, in case regional pricing matters)
* I prefer platforms/solutions that come with upfront costs instead of per-pull/use costs, so that's it's easier to manage the finances involved
* Languages I'm comfortable with are Python and SQL, since these are what I mainly use for work, but willing to learn basics of new languages where necessary 
* Since I will be using my personal computer, which is not that powerful currently, I am looking for a pipeline/platform that I can use completely via cloud (including running training models) 

# Learning Objectives 

*(aka things I want my platform/s to be able to do)*

**1. Data Gathering/Ingestion/Validation/Transformation/Storage**

* Obviously not too familiar with this step currently, so I ended up lumping a bunch of them together, but essentially ETL
* In terms of data I intend to use, I have three main sources I intend to work my way through, from simple to complex: **(1)** will be starting with ingesting CSV files I get from third-party free data providers like Kaggle, **(2)** then moving on to structured databases from sports stat sites such as BBREF, before  eventually work my way to **(3)** automating data collection from publicly available video games I normally play (Dota 2, Path of Exile -- if it matters)
* I want to be able to load these into SQL tables that I can regularly query form

**2. Data Querying and Extract Cloud Storage**

* I want to then be able to set it up so that I can easily query and then store-via-cloud what I need.
* To make my intention clear, most of my work experience is with AWS Athena and S3, so I hope to get platforms that function similarly.

**3. Cloud-Based Data Processing, Machine Learning, and Visualization**

* I currently do majority of my post-query data processing and modelling locally on my work laptop on Jupyter (via the Anaconda distribution), but one of my key objectives is learning to do all of these on cloud (especially since my peronal computer I'll be using would obviously not be as powerful as what I use for work)
* I definitely prefer Notebook-like environments, so perhaps something like AWS EMR
* My main experience at this level is mainly with Python (using specific packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Numpy, Sklearn, etc.), but I'm looking to do more PySpark as well

**4. EXTRA/OPTIONAL: Dashboard Creation and Hosting**

* If I can get a platform/pipeline that will allow me to host interactive dashboards for me to just embed in my portfolio, that would be a plus, but I am very easily willing to drop this should it not fit my budget

#  Final Remarks

* Want to learn ETL, and cloud-based data processing on a personal data pipeline and processing platform/solution that also has SQL capabilities -- in line with my career and personal learning objectives for the year 
* Tried looking into personal subscriptions for 360 solutions like Databricks and AWS Sagemaker Unified Studio, but was told that for what I want I might be better off with patching together T2 solutions or something along those lines -- but I imagine this would be much more tricky to set up ",2,1,bacon9001,2025-03-30 14:20:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jndfr9/building_a_cloudbased_data_pipeline_for_personal/,0,False,False,False,False

1jnh5oy,"Struggling with Career Path – Stuck in Java, Want to Return to Data Engineering (6.5 YOE)","I've been working in IT for the past 6.5 years. I started as a Java Developer for a year before transitioning into Data Engineering, where I worked with Airflow, GCP, Python, and SQL (BigQuery).

In June 2022, I joined my second company as a Data Engineer, but after just six months, the project was shelved, and I was moved to a Java-based project (Spring Boot, Kafka, etc.). This happened during a market downturn and layoffs, so I was grateful to still have a job.

Now, after two years in this role, I feel stuck. I struggle with coding, don’t enjoy Java, and constantly feel like an imposter. I know for sure that I don’t want to continue in Java and Spring Boot. However, I’ve stayed in this role because it’s high-paying, and I have family responsibilities (supporting a family of five).

I want to transition back into Data Engineering, but now the job market expects a higher level of expertise given my experience and salary range. I’m unsure about the best way to upskill and make this switch without a major setback.

How can I strategically transition back into Data Engineering while balancing financial stability? Would love advice from those who have made similar career shifts.

1jmzte8,Need help for a small website design choices,"I am working on a website whose job is to serve data from MongoDb. Just textual data in row format nothing complicated. 

This is my current setup: client sends a request to cloudfront that manages the cache and triggers a lambda for a cache miss to query from MongoDB. I also use signedurl for security purposes for each request. 

I am not an expert that but I think cloud front can handle DDoS attacks etc. Does this setup work or do I need to bring in API Gateway into the fold? I don’t have any user login etc. and no form on the website (no sql injection risk I guess). I don’t know much about network security etc but have heard horror stories of websites getting hacked etc. Hence am a bit paranoid before launching the website. 

Based on some reading, I came to the conclusion that I need to use AWS WAF + API Gateway for dynamic queries and AWS + cloud front for static pages. And lambda should be associated with API Gateway to connect with MongoDB and API Gateway does rate limiting and caching (user authentication is no big a problem here). I wonder if cloudfront is even needed or should just stick with the current architecture I have. 

Need your suggestions.
