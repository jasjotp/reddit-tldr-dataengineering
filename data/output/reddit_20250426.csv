1k7lp9q,Best approach for reading partitioned Parquet data: Python (Pandas/Polars) vs AWS Athena?,"I’m working with ~500GB of partitioned Parquet files stored in S3. The data is primarily used for ML model training and evaluation — I rarely read the full dataset, mostly filtered subsets based on partitions.

I’m evaluating two options:
	1.	Python (Pandas/Polars) — reading directly from S3 using tools like s3fs, pyarrow.dataset, etc., running on either local machine or SageMaker.
	2.	AWS Athena — creating external tables over the same partitioned Parquet files and querying using SQL.

What I care about:
	•	Cost-effectiveness — Athena charges per TB scanned; Python reads would run on local/SageMaker.
	•	Performance — especially for slicing subsets and preparing data for ML pipelines.
	•	Flexibility — need to do transformations (feature engineering, filtering, joins) before passing to ML models.

Which approach would you recommend for this kind of workflow?",20,18,ExcitingAd7292,2025-04-25 14:02:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k7lp9q/best_approach_for_reading_partitioned_parquet/,0,False,False,False,False

1k7cj7i,How Do You Track Column-Level Lineage Between dbt/SQLMesh and Power BI (with Snowflake)?,"Hey all,

I’m using Snowflake for our data warehouse and just recently got our team set up with Git/source control. Now we’re looking to roll out either dbt or SQLMesh for transformations (I've been able to sell the team on its value as it's something I've seen work very well in another company I worked at).

One of the biggest unknowns (and requirements the team has) is tracking column-level lineage across dbt/SQLMesh and Power BI.

Essentially, I want to find a way to use a DAG (and/or testing on a pipeline) to track dependencies so that we can assess how upstream database changes might impact reports in Power BI.

For example: if an employee opens a pull/merge request in GIT to modify TABLE X (change/delete a column), running a command like 'dbt run' (crude example, I know) would build everything downstream and trigger a warning that the column they removed/changed is used in a Power BI report.

Important: it has to be at a column level. Model level is good to start but we'll need both.

Has anyone found good ways to manage this?

I'd love to hear about any tools, workflows, or best practices that are relevant.

1k7n4uc,How do you guys deal with unexpected datatypes in ETL processes?,"I tend to code my own ETL processes in Python, but it's a pretty frustrating process because, when you make an API call, literally anything can come through.

What do you guys do to make foolproof ETL scripts?

My edge case:

Today, an ETL process that has successfully imported thousands or rows of data without issue got tripped up on this line:

    new_entry['utm_medium'] = tracking_code.get('c_src', '').lower() or ''

I guess, this time, ""c\_src"" was present in the data, but it was explicitly set to ""None"" so, instead of returning '', it just crashed the whole function.

Which is fine, and I can update my logic to deal with that, so I'm not looking for help with this specific issue. I'm just curious what approaches other people take to avoid this when literally anything imaginable could come in with an ETL process and, if it's not what you're expecting, it could just stop the whole process.",12,20,takenorinvalid,2025-04-25 15:02:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k7n4uc/how_do_you_guys_deal_with_unexpected_datatypes_in/,0,False,False,False,False

I haven’t had any internships, since I just switched into the Data Science major. I’m also considering taking a minor in statistics, and I want to set myself up for success in Data Engineering once I graduate. Given my situation, what advice would you offer? I’m not sure if a Master’s is useful in the field, or if a PhD is important. Are there majors which would make me better equipped for the field, and how can I set myself up best to get an internship for Summer 2026?

1k7nb1b,Optimizing a Debezium Mongo source connector,"Hey all!I hope everyone here is doing great.I'm running some performance benchmarks for the Mongo connector and comparing it against another tool that I'm already using. Given my limited experience with Debezium's Mongo connector, I thought I'd ask for some ideas around tuning it.:)

The test is set up so that Kafka Connect, Mongo and Kafka are run as containers. Once a connector (or generally a pipeline) is created, the Kafka destination topic is monitored for throughput. This particular test focuses on CDC (there's another one for snapshots) and is using Kafka Connect 7.8 and Mongo connector 3.1.

I went through all the properties in the Mongo connector and tuned those that I thought made sense tuning. Those are:

  
`""key.converter.schemas.enable"": false,`  
`""value.converter.schemas.enable"": false,`  
  
`""key.converter"": ""org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter"",`  
`""value.converter"": ""org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter"",`  
  
`""max.batch.size"": 64000,`  
`""max.queue.size"": 128000,`

`""producer.override.batch.size"": 1000000`

The full configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/ConduitIO/streaming-benchmarks/blob/df8dc6f5dc05a48eb15ee3e9518d2080cf90210e/benchmarks/mongo-kafka-cdc/kafka-connect-dbz/data/connector.json).

Additionally I've set the Kafka Connect worker's heap to 10 GB. The whole test is run on EC2 (on an instance with 8 vCPUs and 32 GiB of memory).

Any comments on whether this makes sense or how to tune it even more are greatly appreciated.:)

1k7hxii,Delta Load Into an Enrichment Layer,"Hello!   
  
I have a bit challenging question about how to design a datapipeline. 

I use databricks to handle the movement and transformation from schema to schema (layer). I use a raw schema where table resides with standard columns such as business\_valid\_from, business\_valid\_to, and for bi-temporality these tables also have applied\_valid\_from and applied\_valid\_to.

I am about to extract data from these raw tables into my enrichment layer where I wish to join and transform 2 or more tables into 1 table.

I only wish to extract the last changed data from the raw vault (delta load) since last extract (timestamp determined either by the max date in encrichment table or the last runtime in a metadata table). 

What I find difficult is fx if I have 2 tables (table\_a and table\_b) that I need to extract new data from. Then I need to ensure that if table\_a has a changed row from 1 week ago and table\_b does does not have changed row from 1 week ago - then I will get rows from table\_a but none from table\_b and when I join these two tables then table\_a will not get any data from table\_b (either null or no rows if I use inner join).

How can I ensure that if table\_a has updated/changed rows  from some time back then I will also could find these 'joinable' rows in table\_b even if these rows has not been updated?

(extra note on this)  
Before anyone says that I need to delta load each table separately and deterimine what business dates that will be needed for all tables - then please know I have already done that. That solution is not great because there is always some row that has been updated, and that row has a business\_valid\_from long ago fx 2012. This would result in a long list of business days that will be needed for all table - and then it defeats the purpose of the delta load.
