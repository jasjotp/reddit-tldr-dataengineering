1kb974e,Spark is the new Hadoop,"In this opinionated article I am going to explain why I believe we have reached peak Spark usage and why it is only downhill from here.

# Before Spark

Some will remember that 12 years ago [Pig](https://pig.apache.org), [Hive](https://hive.apache.org), [Sqoop](https://sqoop.apache.org), [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org) and MapReduce were all the rage. Many of us were under the spell of [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org) during those times.

# Enter Spark

The brilliant [Matei Zaharia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateizaharia/) started working on Spark sometimes before 2010 already, but adoption really only began after 2013.  
The lazy evaluation and memory leveraging as well as other [innovative features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0Tisli7zn4&t=97s) were a huge leap forward and I was dying to try this new promising technology.  
My then CTO was visionary enough to understand the potential and for years since, I, along with many others, ripped the benefits of an only improving Spark.

# The Loosers

How many of you recall companies like [Hortonworks](https://hortonworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Webinar.HDP2_.20131112.pdf) and [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/about.html)? Hortonworks and Cloudera merged after both becoming public, only to be taken private a few years later. Cloudera still exists, but not much more than that.

Those companies were yesterday’s [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com) and they bet big on the Hadoop ecosystem and not so much on Spark.

# Hunting decisions

In creating Spark, Matei did what any pragmatist would have done, he piggybacked on the existing Hadoop ecosystem. This allowed Spark not to be built from scratch in isolation, but integrate nicely in the Hadoop ecosystem and supporting tools.

There is just one problem with the Hadoop ecosystem…it’s exclusively **JVM based**. This decision has fed and made rich thousands of consultants and engineers that have fought with the [GC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) and inconsistent memory issues for years…and still does. The JVM is a solid choice, safe choice, but despite more than 10 years passing and Databricks having the plethora of resources it has, some of Spark's core issues with managing memory and performance just can't be fixed.

# The writing is on the wall

Change is coming, and few are noticing it ([some do](https://nolanlawson.com/2024/10/20/why-im-skeptical-of-rewriting-javascript-tools-in-faster-languages/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). This change is happening in all sorts of supporting tools and frameworks.

What do [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), [Deno](https://deno.com), [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) and the Linux kernel all have in common that no one cares about...for now? They all have a Rust backend or have an increasingly large Rust footprint. These handful of examples are just the tip of the iceberg.

Rust is the most prominent example and the forerunner of a set of languages that offer performance, a completely different memory model and some form of usability that is hard to find in market leaders such as C and C++. There is also Zig which similar to Rust, and a bunch of other languages that can be found in TIOBE's top 100.

The examples I gave above are all of tools for which the primary target are not Rust engineers but Python or JavaScipt. Rust and other languages that allow easy interoperability are increasingly being used as an efficient reliable backend for frameworks targeted at completely different audiences.

There's going to be less of ""by Python developers for Python developers"" looking forward.

# Nothing is forever

Spark is here to stay for many years still, hey, Hive is still being used and maintained, but I belive that peak adoption has been reached, there's nowhere to go from here than downhill. Users don't have much to expect in terms of performance and usability looking forward.

On the other hand, frameworks like [Daft](https://www.getdaft.io) offer a completely different experience working with data, no strange JVM error messages, no waiting for things to boot, just bliss. Maybe it's not Daft that is going to be the next best thing, but it's inevitable that Spark will be overthroned.

# Adapt

Databricks better be ahead of the curve on this one.  
Instead of using scaremongering marketing gimmicks like labelling the use of engines other than Spark as *Allow External Data Access*, it better ride with the wave.",246,98,rocketinter,2025-04-30 05:45:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kb974e/spark_is_the_new_hadoop/,0,False,False,False,False
1kbbgjb,Why are more people not excited by Polars?,"I’ve benchmarked it. For use cases in my specific industry it’s something like x5, x7 more efficient in computation. It looks like it’s pretty revolutionary in terms of cost savings. It’s faster and cheaper.

The problem is PySpark is like using a missile to kill a worm. In what I’ve seen, it’s totally overpowered for what’s actually needed. It starts spinning up clusters and workers and all the tasks. 

I’m not saying it’s not useful. It’s needed and crucial for huge workloads but most of the time huge workloads are not actually what’s needed.

Spark is perfect with big datasets and when huge data lake where complex computation is needed. It’s a marvel and will never fully disappear for that.

Also Polars syntax and API is very nice to use. It’s written to use only one node. 

By comparison Pandas syntax is not as nice (my opinion). 

And it’s computation is objectively less efficient.  It’s simply worse than Polars in nearly every metric in efficiency terms.

I cant publish the stats because it’s in my company enterprise solution but search on open Github other people are catching on and publishing metrics.

Polars uses Lazy execution, a Rust based computation (Polars is a Dataframe library for Rust). Plus Apache Arrow data format.

It’s pretty clear it occupies that middle ground where Spark is still needed for 10GB/ terabyte / 10-15 million row+ datasets. 

Pandas is useful for small scripts (Excel, Csv) or hobby projects but Polars can do everything Pandas can do and faster and more efficiently.

Spake is always there for the those use cases where you need high performance but don’t need to call in artillery. 

Its syntax means if you know Spark is pretty seamless to learn.

I predict as well there’s going to be massive porting to Polars for ancestor input datasets.

You can use Polars for the smaller inputs that get used further on and keep Spark for the heavy workloads. The problem is converting to different data frames object types and data formats is tricky. Polars is very new.

Many legacy stuff in Pandas over 500k rows where costs is an increasing factor or cloud expensive stuff is also going to see it being used.

1kbctlt,Reflecting On A Year's Worth of Data Engineer Work,"Hey All,

I've had an incredible year and I feel extremely lucky to be in the position I'm in. I'm a relatively new DE, but I've covered so much ground even in one year.

I'm not perfect, but I can feel my growth. Every day I am learning something new and I'm having such joy improving on my craft, my passion, and just loving my experience each day building pipelines, debugging errors, and improving upon existing infrastructure.

As I look back I wanted to share some gems or bits of valuable knowledge I've picked up along the way:

* Showing up in person to the office matters. Your communication, attitude, humbleness, kindness, and selflessness goes a long way and gets noticed. Your relationship with your client matters a lot and being able to be in person means you are the go-to engineer when people need help, education, and fixing things when they break. Working from home is great, but there are more opportunities when you show up for your client in person.
* pre-commit hooks are valuable in creating quality commits. Automatically check yourself even before creating a PR. Use hooks to format your code, scan for errors with linters, etc.
* Build pipelines with failure in mind. Always factor in exception handling, error logging, and other tools to gracefully handle when things go wrong.
* DRY - such as a basic principle but easy to forget. Any time you are repeating yourself or writing code that is duplicated, it's time to turn that into a function. And if you need to keep track of state, use OOP.
* Learn as much as you can about CI/CD. The bugs/issues in CI/CD are a different beast, but peeling back the layers it's not so bad. Practice your understanding of how it all works, it's crucial in DE.
* OOP is a valuable tool. But you need to know when to use it, it's not a hammer you use at every problem. I've seen examples of unnecessary OOP where a FP paradigm was better suited. Practice, practice, practice.
* Build pipelines that heal themselves and parametrize them so users can easily re-run them for data recovery. Use watermarks to know when the last time a table was last updated in the data lake and create logic so that the pipeline will know to recover data from a certain point in time.
* Be the documentation king/queen. Use docstrings, type hints, comments, markdown files, CHANGELOG files, README, etc. throughout your code, modules, packages, repo, etc. to make your work as clear, intentional, and easy to read as possible. Make it easy to spread this information using an appropriate knowledge management solution like Confluence.
* Volunteer to make things better without being asked. Update legacy projects/repos with the latest code or package. Build and create the features you need to make DE work easier. For example, auto-tagging commits with the version number to easily go back to the snapshot of a repo with a long history.
* Unit testing is important. Learn pytest framework, its tools, and practice making your code modular to make unit tests easier to create.
* Create and use a DE repo template using cookiecutter to create consistency in repo structures in all DE projects and include common files (yaml, .gitignore, etc.).
* Knowledge of fundamental SQL if valuable in understanding how to manipulate data. I found it made it easier understanding pandas and pyspark frameworks.

1kbbc09,Advice on upskilling to break into top data engineering roles,"Hi all,  
I am currently working as a data engineer \~3 YOE currently on notice period of 90 days and Iam looking for guidance on how to upskill and prepare myself to land a job at a top tier company (like FAANG, product-based, or top tech startups).

**My current tech stack:**

* **Languages**: Python, SQL, PLSQL
* **Cloud/Tools**: Snowflake, AWS (Glue, Lambda, S3, EC2, SNS, SQS, Step Functions), Airflow
* **Frameworks**: PySpark (beginner to intermediate), Spark SQL, Snowpark, DBT, Flask, Streamlit
* **Others**: Git, CI/CD, DevOps basics, Schema Change, basic ML knowledge

**What I’ve worked on:**

* designed and scaled etl pipelines with AWS Glue and S3 supporting 10M+ daily records
* developed PySpark jobs for large-scale data transformations 
* built near real time and batch pipelines using Glue, Lambda, Snowpipe, Step Functions, etc.
* Created a Streamlit based analytics dashboard on Snowflake
* worked with RBAC, data masking, CDC, performance tuning in Snowflake
* Built a reusable ETL and Audit Balance Control
* experience with CICD pipelines for code promotion and automation

I feel I have a good base but want to know:

* What skills or tools should I focus on next?
* Is my current stack aligned with what top companies expect?
* Should I go deeper into pyspark or explore something like kafka, kubernetes, data modeling
* How important are system design or coding DSA for data engineer interviews?

would really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or learning paths.

1kbt10i,An open-source framework to build analytical backends,"Hey all! 

Over the years, I’ve worked at companies as small as a team of 10 and at organizations with thousands of data engineers, and I’ve seen wildly different philosophies around analytical data.

Some organizations go with the ""build it and they will come"" data lake approach, broadly ingesting data without initial structure, quality checks, or governance, and later deriving value via a medallion architecture.

Others embed governed analytical data directly into their user-facing or internal operations apps. These companies tend to treat their data like core backend services managed with a focus on getting schemas, data quality rules, and governance right from the start. Similar to how transactional data is managed in a classic web app.

I’ve found that most data engineering frameworks today are designed for the former state, Airflow, Spark, and DBT really shine when there’s a lack of clarity around how you plan on leveraging your data. 

I’ve spent the past year building an open-source framework around a data stack that's built for the latter case (clickhouse, redpanda, duckdb, etc)—when companies/teams know what they want to do with their data and need to build analytical backends that power user-facing or operational analytics quickly.

The framework has the following core principles behind it:

1. Derive as much of the infrastructure as possible from the business logic to minimize the amount of boilerplate
2. Enable a local developer experience so that I could build my analytical backends right alongside my Frontend (in my office, in the desert, or on plane)
3. Leverage data validation standards— like types and validation libraries such as pydantic or typia—to enforce data quality controls and make testing easy
4. Build in support for the best possible analytical infra while keeping things extensible to incrementally support legacy and emerging analytical stacks
5. Support the same languages we use to build transactional apps. I started with Python and TypeScript but I plan to expand to others

The framework is still in beta and it’s now used by teams at big and small companies to build analytical backends. I’d love some feedback from this community

You can take it for a spin by starting from a boilerplate starter project:[ https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/quickstart](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/quickstart)

1kbbml9,Why does nobody ever talk about CKAN or the Data Package standard here?,"I've been messing around with CKAN and the whole Data Package spec lately, and honestly, I'm kind of surprised they barely get mentioned on this sub.

For those who haven't come across them:

CKAN is this open-source platform for publishing and managing datasets—used a lot in gov/open data circles.

Data Packages are basically a way to bundle your data (like CSVs) with a datapackage.json file that describes the schema, metadata, etc.

They're not flashy, no Spark, no dbt, no “AI-ready” marketing buzz - but they're super practical for sharing structured data and automating ingestion. Especially if you're dealing with datasets or anything that needs to be portable and well-documented.

So my question is: why don't we talk about them more here? Is it just too ""dataset"" focused? Too old-school? Or am I missing something about why they aren't more widely used in modern data workflows?

1kb9f2r,Feedback on Achitecture - Compute shift to Azure Function,"Hi. 

Im looking to moving the computer to an Azure Function being orchestrated by ADF and merge into SQL. 

I need to pick which plan to go with and estimate my usage. I know I'll need VNET.

Im ingesting data from adls2 coming down a synapse link pipeline from d365fo.

Unoptimised ADF pipelines sink to an unoptimised Azure SQL Server.

I need to run the pipeline every 15 minutes with Max 1000 row updates on 150 tables. By my research 1 vCPU should easily cover this on the premium subscription.

Appreciate any assistance.

1kbjqwm,Nielsen data sourcing,Question for any DEs working with Nielsen data. How is your company sourcing the data? Is the discover tool really the usual option.

1kbjfrf,Databricks Notebook is failing after If Condition Fail,"There may be some nuance in ADF that I'm missing, but I can't solve this issue. I have an ADF pipeline that has an If Condition. If the If Condition fails I want to get the error details from the Error Details box, you can get those details from the JSON. After getting the details I have a Databricks notebook that should take those details and add them to an error logging table. The Databricks notebook connects to function that acts as a stored proc, unfortunately Databricks doesn't support stored procs. I know they have videos on it, but their own software says it doesn't support stored procs. 

The issue I'm having is the Databricks notebooks fails to execute if the If Condition fails. From what I can tell the parameters aren't being passed through and the expressions used in the Base parameters aren't being executed.

 I figured it should still run on Completion, but the parameters from the If Condition are only being passed when the If Condition succeeds. Originally the If Condition was the last step of the nested pipeline, I'm adding the Databricks notebook to track when the pipeline fails on that step. The If Condition is nested within a ForEach loop. I tried to set the Databricks to run after the ForEach loop but I keep getting a BadRequest error. 

Any tips or advice is welcome, I can also add any details. ",1,0,hijkblck93,2025-04-30 15:33:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kbjfrf/databricks_notebook_is_failing_after_if_condition/,0,False,False,False,False
1kb3xl7,Advice on picking an audience in large datasets,"Hey everyone, I’m new here and found this subreddit while digging around online trying to find help with a pretty specific problem. I came across a few tips that kinda helped, but I’m still feeling a bit stuck.

I’m working on building an automated cold email outreach system that realtors can use to find and warm up leads. I’ve done this before for B2B using big data sources, where I can just filter and sort to target the right people.

Where I’m getting stuck is figuring out what kind of audience actually makes sense for real estate. I’ve got a few ideas, like using filters for job changes, relocations, or other life events that might mean someone is about to buy or sell. After that, it’s mostly just about sending the right message at scale.

But I’m also wondering if there are better data sources or other ways to find high signal leads. I’ve heard of scraping real estate sites for certain types of listings, and that could work, but I’m not totally sure how strong that data would be. If anyone here has tried something similar or has any ideas, even if it’s just a different perspective on my approach, I’d really appreciate it.",1,1,Emergency-Diet-9087,2025-04-30 00:52:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kb3xl7/advice_on_picking_an_audience_in_large_datasets/,0,False,False,False,False
1kbcn8e,Stuck Between Two Postgrads: Which One’s Better for Data?,"Which postgrad is more worth it for the data job market in 2025: Database Systems Engineering or Data Science?

The Database Systems track focuses on pipelines, data modeling, SQL, and governance. The Data Science one leans more into Python, machine learning, and analytics.

Right now, my work is basically Analytics Engineering for BI – I build pipelines, model data, and create dashboards.

I'm trying to figure out which path gives the best balance between risk and return:

Risk: Skill gaps, high competition, or being out of sync with what companies want.

Return: Salary, job demand, and growth potential.


Which one lines up better with where the data market is going?",0,2,Quarter_Advanced,2025-04-30 09:56:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kbcn8e/stuck_between_two_postgrads_which_ones_better_for/,0,False,False,False,False
1kbppmh,How Data Warehousing Drives Student Success and Institutional Efficiency,"Colleges and universities today are sitting on a goldmine of data—from enrollment records to student performance reports—but few have the infrastructure to use that information strategically.

A modern **data warehouse** consolidates all institutional data in one place, allowing universities to:  
🔹 Spot early signs of student disengagement  
🔹 Optimize resource allocation  
🔹 Speed up reporting processes for accreditation and funding  
🔹 Improve operational decision-making across departments

Without a strong data strategy, higher ed institutions risk falling behind in today's competitive and fast-changing landscape.
