1l327w2,"When using orchestrator, do you write your ETL code inside the orchestrator or outside of it?","By outside, I mean the orchestrator runs an external script or docker image. Something like BashOperator or KubernetesPodsOperator in Airflow.

Any experiences on both approach? Pros and Cons?

Some that I can think of for writing inside the orchestrator.

Pros:

\- Easier to manage since everything is in one place.

\- Able to use the full features of the orchestrator.

\-  Variables, Connections and Credentials are easier to manage.

Cons:

\- Tightly coupled with the orchestrator. Migrating your code might be annoying if you want to use different orchestrator.

\- Testing your code is not really easy.

\- Can only use python.

For writing code outside the orchestrator, it is pretty much the opposite of the above.

Thoughts?

1l2sbm1,How Do You Organize A PySpark/Databricks Project,"Hey all,

I've been learning Spark/PySpark recently and I'm curious about how production projects are typically structured and organized.

My background is in DBT, where each model (table/view) is defined in a SQL file, and DBT builds a DAG automatically using `ref()` calls. For example:

    -- modelB.sql
    SELECT colA FROM {{ ref('modelA') }}
    

This ensures `modelA` runs before `modelB`. DBT handles the dependency graph for you, parallelizes independent models for faster builds, and allows for targeted runs using tags. It also supports automated tests defined in YAML files, which run before the associated models.

I'm wondering how similar functionality is achieved in Databricks. Is lineage managed manually, or is there a framework to define dependencies and parallelism? How are tests defined and automatically executed? I'd also like to understand how this works in vanilla Spark without Databricks.

  
TLDR - How are Databricks or vanilla Spark projects organized in production. How are things like 100s of tables, lineage/DAGs, orchestration, and tests managed?

1l3a0yc,[Architecture Feedback Request] Taking external API → Azure Blob → Power BI Service,"Hei! I’m designing a solution to pull daily survey data from an external API and load it into Power BI Service in a secure and automated way. Here’s the main idea:

	•	Use an Azure Function to fetch paginated API data and store it in Azure Blob Storage (daily-partitioned .json files).

	•	Power BI connects to the Blob container, dynamically loads the latest file/folder, and refreshes on schedule.

	•	No API calls happen inside Power BI Service (to avoid dynamic data source limitations). I was trying to do normal built-in GET API from Power BI Service but it doesn't accept dynamic data sources (Power BI Desktop works well, no issues) as API usually does.

	•	Everything is designed with data protection and scalability in mind — future-compatible with Fabric Lakehouse.
P/S: The reason we are forced to go with this solution without using Fabric architecture because it requires cost-effective solution and Fabric integration is planning to be deployed in our organization (potentially project starts from November)

Looking for feedback on:

	•	Anything I might be missing?

	•	Any more robust or elegant approaches?

1l342li,"refactoring my DE code, looking for advice","I'm contracting for a small company as a data analyst, I've written python scripts that run inside docker container on an AZ VM daily to get and transform the data for PBI reporting, current setup:

* API 1:
   * Call 8 different endpoints.
   * some are incremental, some are overwritten daily
   * Have 40 different API keys (think of it like a different logic unit), all calling the same things.
   * they're storing the keys in their MySQL table (I think this is bad, but I have no power over this).
* API 2 and 3:
   * four different endpoints.
   * some are incremental, some are overwritten daily
* DuckDB to transform and throw files to blob storage for reporting.

the problem lies with API 1, it takes long since I'm calling one after another.

I could rewrite the scripts to be async, but might as well make it more scalable and clean, things I'm thinking about, all of them have their own learning curve:

* using docker swarm.
* setting up Airbyte on the VM, since the annoying api is there.
* Setting up Airflow on the VM.
* moving it to Azure container App jobs and removing the VM all together.
   * this saves a bit of money, but not a big deal at this scale.
   * this is way more scalable and cleanest.
   * googling around about container apps, I can't figure out if I can orchestrate it using Azure Data Factory.
   * can't figure out how to dynamically create the replicas for the 40 Keys
      * I can either just export template and have one job for each one and add new ones as needed (not often).
      * write orchestration myself.
* write them as AZ Flex functions (in case it goes over 10 minutes), still would need to figure out orchestration.

1l3ctr5,How To CD Reliably Without Locking?,"So I've been trying to set up a CI/CD pipeline for MSSQL for a bit now. I've never set one up from scratch before and I don't really have anyone in my company/department knowledgeable enough to lean on. We use GitHub for source controlling, so Github Actions is my CI/CD method  
  
Currently, I've explored the following avenues: 

* Redgate Flyway  
   * It sounds nice for migration, but the concept of having to restructure our repo layout and having to have multiple versions of the same file just with the intended changes (assuming I'm understanding how its supposed to work) seems kind of cumbersome and we're kind of trying to get away from Redgate.
* DACPAC Deployment
   * I like the idea, I like the auto diffing and how it automatically knows to alter or create or drop or whatever but this seems to have a whole partial deployment thing in the event of it failing part way through that's hard to get around for me. Not only that, but it seems to diff what's in the DB compared to source control (which, ideally is what we want) but prod has a history of hotfixes (not a deal breaker) and also, the DB settings are default ANSI NULLS Enabled: False + Quoted Identifiers Enabled: False. Modifying this setting on the DB is apparently not an option which means Devs will have to enable it at the file level in the sqlproj.
* Bash
   * Writing a custom bash script that takes only the changes meant to be applied per PR and deploys them. This however, will require plenty of testing and maintenance and I'm terrified of allowing table renames and alterations because of dataloss. Procs and Views can probably be just dropped and re-created as a means of deployment, but not really a great option for Functions and UDTs because of possible dependencies and certainly not for tables. This also has partial deployment issues that I can't skirt with transaction wrapping the entire deploy...

For reference, I work for a company where NOLOCK is commonplace in queries so locking tables for pretty much any amount of time is a non-negotiable no. I'd want the ability to rollback deployments in the event of failure, but if I'm not able to use transactions, I'm not sure what options I have since I'm inexperienced in this avenue.

1l3ao9a,My experience with Data Engineer Academy,"I'm starting a new career in data, and what I've been noticing is that a lot of these courses and platforms only teach surface-level skills in SQL, Python, etc. Maybe because they think learners will learn the in-depth skills on the job? I just wanted to point out that this program has already helped me understand the why behind the tools and skills, and I've only just started. I'm learning that I have gaps and the program has helped me understand advanced concepts, clean code, and optimization. It's been helpful in giving me a strategic, focused, and structured plan to know how to be a better data professional.

1l371v3,"In this modern age of LLMs, do I really need to learn SQL anymore?","With tools like ChatGPT generating queries instantly and so many no-code/low-code solutions out there, is it still worth spending serious time learning SQL?

I get that companies still ask SQL questions during technical assessments, but from what I’ve learned so far, it feels pretty straightforward. I understand the basics, and honestly, asking someone to write SQL from scratch as part of a screening or evaluation seems kinda pointless. It doesn’t really prove anything valuable in my opinion—especially when most of us just look up the syntax or use tools anyway.

Would love to hear how others feel about this—especially people working in data, engineering, or hiring roles. Am I wrong ?",0,26,CreamRoll9,2025-06-04 14:31:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l371v3/in_this_modern_age_of_llms_do_i_really_need_to/,0,False,False,False,False
