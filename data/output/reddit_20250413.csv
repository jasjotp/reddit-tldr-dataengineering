1jxtxqo,How do my fellow on-prem DEs keep their sanity...,"...the joys of memory and compute resources seems to be a neverending suck üò≠

We're building ETL pipelines, using Airflow in one K8s namespace and Spark in another (the latter having dedicated hardware). Most data workloads aren't really Spark-worthy as files are typically <20GB, and we keep hitting pain points where processes struggle in Airflow's memory (workers are 6Gi and 6 CPU, with a limit of 10GI; no KEDA or HPA). We are looking into more efficient data structures like DuckDB, Polars, etc or running ""mid-tier"" processes as separate K8s jobs but then we hit constraints like tools/libraries relying on Pandas use so we seem stuck with eager processes.

Case in point, I just learned that our teams are having to split files into smaller files of 125k records so Pydantic schema validation won't fail on memory. I looked into GX Core and see the main source options there again appear to be Pandas or Spark dataframes (yes, I'm going to try DuckDB through SQLAlchemy). I could bite the bullet and just say to go with Spark, but then our pipelines will be using Spark for QA and not for ETL which will be fun to keep clarifying. 

Sisyphus is the patron saint of Data Engineering... just sayin'

1jxun0q,Data Inserts best practices with Iceberg,"I receive various files at different intervals which are not defined. Can be every seconds, hour, daily, etc.

I don‚Äôt have any indication also of when something is finished. For example, it‚Äôs highly possible to have 100 files that would end up being 100% of my daily table, but I receive them scattered over 15min-30 when the data become available and my ingestion process ingest it. Can be 1 to 12 hours after the day is over.

Not that‚Äôs it‚Äôs also possible to have 10000 very small files per day.

I‚Äôm wondering how is this solves with Iceberg tables. Very newbie Iceberg guy here. Like I don‚Äôt see throughput write benchmark anywhere but I figure that rewriting the metadata files must be a big overhead if there‚Äôs a very large amount of files so inserting every times there‚Äôs a new one must not be the ideal solution.

I‚Äôve read some medium post saying that there was a snapshot feature which track new files so you don‚Äôt have to do some fancy things to load them incrementally. But again if every insert is a query that change the metadata files it must be bad at some point.

Do you wait and usually build a process to store a list of files before inserting them or is this a feature build somewhere already in a doc I can‚Äôt find ?

Any help would be appreciated.

1jxswyj,Dilemma: SWE vs DE @ Big Tech,"I currently work at a Big Tech and have 3 YoE. My role is a mix of Full-Stack + Data Engineering. 

I want to keep preparing for interviews on the side, and to do that I need to know which role to aim for. 

Pros of SWE:
- more jobs positions 
- I have already invested 300 hours into DSA Leetcode. Don‚Äôt have to start DE prep from scratch
-Maybe better quality of work/pay(?)

Pros of DE:
- targeting a niche has always given me more callbacks
- if I practice a lot of sql, the interviews at FAANG could be gamed. FAANG do ask DSA but they barely scratch the surface

My thoughts:
Ideally I want to crack the SWE role at a FAANG as I like both roles equally but SWE pays 20% more. If I don‚Äôt get callbacks for SWE, then securing a similar pay through a DE role at FAANG is lucrative too. 
I‚Äôd be completely fine with doing DE, but I feel uneasy wasting the 100s of hours I spent on DSA. 

Applying for both jobs is sub optimal as I can only sink my time into SQL or DSA | system design or data modelling. 

What do you folks suggest?

1jxdch4,Which API system for my Postgres DWH?,"Hi everyone,

I am building a data warehouse for my company and because we have to process mostly spatial data I went with a postgres materialization. My stack is currently:

- dlt
- dbt
- dagster
- postgres

Now I have the use case that our developers at our company need some of the data for our software solutions to be integrated. And I would like to provide an API for easy access to the data. 

So I am wondering which solution is best for me. I have some experience in a private project with postgREST and found it pretty cool to directly use DB views and functions as endpoints for the API. But tools like FastAPI might be more mature for a production system. What would you recommend?

1jxsce8,I'm struggling to evaluate job offer and would appreciate outside opinions,"I've been searching for a new opportunity over the last few years (500+ applications) and have finally received an offer I'm strongly considering. I would really like to hear some outside opinions.

## Current position
- Analytics Lead
- $126k base, 10% bonus
- Tool stack: on-prem SQL Server, SSIS, Power BI, some Python/R
- Downsides: 
	- Incoherent/non-existent corporate data strategy
	- 3 days required in-office (~20-minute commute)
	- Lack of executive support for data and analytics
	- Data Scientist and Data Engineer roles have recently been eliminated
	- No clear path for additional growth or progression 
	- A significant part of the job involves training/mentoring several inexperienced analysts, which I don't enjoy
- Upsides: 
	- Very stable company (no risk of layoffs)
	- Very good relationship with direct manager

## New offer
- Senior Data Analyst
- $130k base, 10% bonus
- Tool stack: BigQuery, FiveTran, dbt / SQLMesh, Looker Studio, GSheets
- Downsides:
	- High-growth company, potentially volatile industry
- Upsides:
	- Fully remote
	- Working alongside experienced data engineers

Other info/significant factors:
- My current company paid for my MSDS degree, and they are within their right to claw back the entire ~$37k tuition if I leave.  I'm prepared to pay this, but it's a big factor in the decision.
- At this stage in my career, I'm putting a very high value on growth/development opportunities

Am I crazy to consider a lateral move that involves a significant amount of uncompensated risk, just for a potentially better learning and growth opportunity?",4,21,Dozer11,2025-04-12 21:49:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jxsce8/im_struggling_to_evaluate_job_offer_and_would/,0,False,False,False,False

1jxtvbu,Thoughts on Acryl vs other metadata platforms,"Hi all, I'm evaluating metadata management solutions for our data platform and would appreciate any thoughts from folks who've actually implemented these tools in production.

We're currently running into scaling issues with our in-house data catalog and I think we need something more robust for governance and lineage tracking.

I've narrowed it down to Acryl (DataHub) and Collate (openmetadata) as the main contenders. I know I should look at Collibra and Alation and maybe Unity Catalog?

For context, we're a mid-sized fintech (\~500 employees) with about 30 data engineers and scientists. We're AWS with Snowflake, Airflow for orchestration, and a growing number of ML models in production.

My question list is: 

1. How these tools handle machine-scale operations 
2. How painful was it to get set up?
3. For DataHub and openmetadata specifically - is the open source version viable or is the cloud version necessary?
4. Any unexpected limitations you've hit with any of these platforms?
5. Do you feel like these grow with you as we increasingly head into AI governance? 
6. How well they integrate with existing tools (Snowflake, dbt, Looker, etc.)

If anyone has switched from one solution to another, I'd love to hear why you made the change and whether it was worth it.

Sorry for the pick list of questions - the last post on this was years ago and I was hoping for some more insights. Thanks in advance for anyone's thoughts.
