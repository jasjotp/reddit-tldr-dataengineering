1k7214y,Feedback on two rough draft architectures made by a noob.,"I am a SWE with no DE experience. I have been tasked with architecting our storage and ETL pipelines. I took a month long online course leading up to my start date, and have done a ton of research and asked you guys a lot of questions (**thank you!!**). 

All of this study/research has led me to two rough draft architectures to present to my company. I was hoping to get some constructive feedback on them, if you all would do me the honor. 

Here's some context for the images below:

1. Scale of data is many terabytes to a few petabytes uncompressed. Largely sensor data. 
2. Data is initially generated and stored on an air-gapped network. 
3. Data will be moved into a lab by detaching hard-drives. There, we will need to retain some raw data for regulatory purposes, and we will also want to perform ETL into an analytical database/warehouse. 

I have a lot of time to refine these before implementation time, and specific technologies are flexible. but next week I wan to present a *reasonable* view of the types of solutions we might use.  What do you think of this as a first draft? Any obvious show stoppers or bad ideas here?

1k6xfby,Query runs longer than your AWS bill. How do I improve it,"Hey folks,

So I have this query that joins two table, selects a few columns, runs a dense rank and then filters to keep only the rank 1s. Pretty simple right ?

Here’s the kicker. The overpaid, under evolved nit wit who designed the databases didn’t add a single index on either of these tables. Both of which have upwards of 10M records. So, this simple query takes upwards of 90 mins to run and return a result set of 90K records. Unacceptable. 

So, I set out to right this cosmic wrong. My genius idea was to simplify the query to only perform the join and select the required columns. Eliminate the dense rank calculation and filtering. I would then read the data into Polars and then perform the same operations.

Yes, seems weird but here’s the reasoning. I’m accessing the data from a Tibco Data Virtualization layer. And the TDV docs themselves admit that running analytical functions on TDV causes a major performance hit. So it kinda makes sense to eliminate the analytical function. 

And it worked. Kind of. The time to read in the data from the DB was around 50 minutes. And Polars ran the dense rank and filtering in a matter of seconds. So, the total run time dropped to around half, even though I’m transferring a lot more data. Decent trade off in my book. 

But the problem is, I’m still not satisfied. I feel like there should be more I can do. I’d appreciate any suggestions and I’d be happy to provide any additional details. Thanks.

1k6zbhh,Best approach to warehousing flats,"I have about 20 years worth of flat files stored in a folder on a network drive as a result of lackluster data practices. Essentially, three different flat files get printed to this folder on a nightly bases that represent three different types of data (think: person, sales, products). Essentially this data could exist as three separate long tables with date as key. 

I'd like to establish a proper data warehouse, but am unsure of how to best handle the process of warehousing these flats. I have been interfacing with the data through Python Pandas so far, but the company has a SQL server...It would probably be best to place the warehouse as a database on the server, then pull/manipulate the data from there? But what is tripping me up is the order of operations to perform in the warehousing procedure. I don't believe I would be able to dump into SQL server without profiling the data first as number of columns and the type of data stored in the flat files may have changed throughout the years.



I am essentially struggling with how to sequence the process of : network drive flats > sql server db:

  
My concerns are:

Best method to profile the data?

Best way to store the metadata?

Throw flats into SQL server and then query them from there to perform data transformations/validations? 

  \-- It seems without knowing the meta data, I should perform this step in Pandas first before loading into SQL server? What is the best practice for that? perform operations on each flat file separately or combine first (e.g., should I clean the data during the loop or after combining tables)?

   \-- Right now, I am creating a list of flat files, using that list to create a dictionary of dataframes, and then using that dictionary to create a dataframe of dataframes to group and concatenate into 3 long tables -- am I convoluting this process?

How to approach data cleaning/validation/and additional column calculations? e.g. -- Should I perform these procedures on each file separately before concatenating into a long table or perform these procedures after concatenation?-- Should I even concatenate into longs or keep them separate and define a relationship to their keys stored in a separate table?

How many databases for this process? One for raws? One for staging? A third as the datawarehouse to be queried?

When to stage and how much of the process to perform in RAM/behind the scenes before printing to a new table?

Should I consider compressing the data at any point in the process? (e.g. store as Parquet)



The data gets used for data analytics and to assemble reports/dashboards. Ideally, I would like to eliminate having to perform as many joins as possible during the querying for analysis process. I'd also like to orchestrate the warehouse so that adjustments only need to happen in a single place and propagate throughout the pipeline with a history of adjustments stored as record.",3,2,Kate-WeHaveToGoBack,2025-04-24 18:18:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k6zbhh/best_approach_to_warehousing_flats/,0,False,False,False,False

1k6j6ay,Scope of data engineering,"A few years ago I worked on a project that involved running distributed computations on a spark cluster (AWS ec2 machines). The data was pulled from data sources (CSV files in S3) and transformed and stored in parquet files, which were then fed in the computation engine running on spark, the output of which was mostly stored in a transactional database. The transactional db in turn powered a user interface.  

The computation engine ran as a job in the pipeline (processing high volume data) as well as upon user actions on the UI (low volume calculations). This computation engine was pretty complex component, doing a bunch of different things. Given the complexity, there was a strong need to have a properly structured code that stays maintainable, as a large team worked just on this. Also as this was the slowest component of the pipeline, there was also a need to be well versed in how spark works internally, so that well optimized code is written. The codebase was in scala.

My question is - does this component come under the purview of a data engineer or a software engineer. As I mentioned this was several years ago, and ""data engineer"" title was only gradually picking up at that time. All of us were SWE then (most transitioned into a DE role subsequently). I ask this question because I've come across several data engineers who have pretty strong demarcations around what a data engineer shouldn't be doing.

I have tried LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), which has various word libraries for each dimension and simply checks those words in the comments to give a rating. But this is not working.

However, we’ve run into issues with real-time ingestion.

But a smaller company with 4 employees, a startup, specially one located on other regions beyond us-east, simply saying you need 5x 4xlarge instances is, well, a lot...  
(for comparison, in my country, 5kUSD pays the salary of all members of the team and cover most of our other costs. and we have above average salaries for staff engineers...)  
  
I initially set my Trino cluster up with a 8gb ram machine and workers with 4 gb (t3.large and t3.medium on aws Ec2) and trino is actually working well, I have a 2TB dataset, which for many, is actually enough space.

Am I missing something? Is Trino bad as a simple solution for something like simply replacing athena queries costs and having more control over my data? Should i be looking somewhere else? Or is this just simply a problem of ""usually companies have a bigger budget?""

How can i get what is really a minimum baseline for using it?

1k6ugw8,Just realized that I don't fully understand how Snowflake decouples storage and compute. What happens behind the scenes from when I submit a query to when I see the results?,"I've worked with Snowflake for a while and understood that storage was separated from compute. In my head that makes sense but practically speaking realized I didn't know how a query is processed and data is loaded from storage onto a DW. Is there anything special going on? 

For example, let's say I have a table employees without any partitioning and run a basic query of `select department, count(*) from employees where start_date > '2020-01-01'` and using a Large data warehouse. Can someone explain what happens after I hit run on the query until I see the results?",0,6,jbnpoc,2025-04-24 15:03:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k6ugw8/just_realized_that_i_dont_fully_understand_how/,0,False,False,False,False
1k6l84c,[Help Needed] Trying to build a real-time MongoDB + Neo4j project — does this make sense?,"Hi everyone 👋

I’m trying to work on a new project to improve my data engineering skills and would love to get some advice from people more experienced in real-world systems.

# 🔁 What I’m Trying to Do:

I previously built a Medallion Architecture project using MongoDB, Pandas, and PostgreSQL (Bronze → Silver → Gold). It helped me understand the basics of ELT pipelines.

Now I want to do something different, so I’m trying to build a **real-time pipeline** that also uses **graph modeling**. Here’s my rough idea:

* Use **MongoDB Atlas** to store real-time event data (e.g., product views, purchases)
* Use **AWS Lambda** to process/clean those events.
* Push the cleaned events into **Neo4j** to create user-product relationships (for example: `(:User)-[:VIEWED]->(:Product)`)

I’d also like to simulate the stream using Python + Faker, just to have some data coming in regularly.

# 🙋‍♂️ Where I’m Stuck / Need Help:

1. **Is it even a good idea to combine MongoDB and Neo4j like this?** Or should I focus on just one?
2. Are there any common mistakes or traps I should watch out for with this kind of setup?
3. Any suggestions on making it more realistic or structured like a production system?

I’m still learning and trying to figure out how to make this useful, so any feedback or tips would mean a lot.

Thanks in advance 🙏",0,1,Loud-Effective7198,2025-04-24 06:11:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k6l84c/help_needed_trying_to_build_a_realtime_mongodb/,0,False,2025-04-24 07:00:27,False,False
1k776e5,How Should I Approach My Job Search As An Eager Learner with Limited Experience?,"I come from a non-technical degree and self-taught background and I work for a US non-profit where I wear many hats; data engineer, Microsoft Power Platform developer, Data Analyst, and User Support. I want to move to a more specialized DE role. We currently have an on-premise SQL Server stack with a pipeline managed by SSIS packages that feed into an SSAS cube as our warehouse for reporting in Power BI reports that I also develop.

Our senior DE retired last year and I have been solely managing and trying to modernize the pipeline and warehouse since as much as I can with an on-premise setup. I pushed for a promotion and raise in the wake of that but the organization is stubborn and it was denied. I have completed the Data Talks Studio DE Zoomcamp certificate in an effort to show that I am eager to move into more cloud based data engineering despite my limited professional experience.

I need to leave this job as they are unwilling to match my responsibilities with an appropriate salary. My question to the sub is what approach should I take to my job search? Where should I be looking for jobs? What kinds of jobs should I be looking for? Should I look for bridge roles like Data Analyst or Analytics Engineer? If anyone would be willing to mentor me through this a bit, that would also be greatly appreciated.",0,0,cjones91594,2025-04-24 23:57:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k776e5/how_should_i_approach_my_job_search_as_an_eager/,0,False,False,False,False

1k6nokk,EY GDS vs Deloitte India for Azure Data Engineer,"Hi folks,  
I got two offers in hand, one is from EY GDS for 10.5LPA + 5% VBA (which I heard people actually get around 10-20% on a A or B rating) and Deloitte India 11 LPA + 10% VPB (Didn't accepted the offer yet, asked for 14 LPA ). Which one should I join, which is better in terms of projects, work culture and career growth. I have 5 days to decide.",0,4,Creepy_Area5974,2025-04-24 09:06:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k6nokk/ey_gds_vs_deloitte_india_for_azure_data_engineer/,0,False,False,False,False
1k6idhk,Which degree has the best ROI,"Hi all. I’m considering another degree to put off paying back student loans. In the US if you’re in school at least part time (6 hours every long semester) your loans will be in deferment and not impacting your credit. I’m curious what degree (preferably online) has the best ROI. I’m a Senior Azure Data Engineer and I already have a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Management Information Systems. I was thinking of maybe getting an associates in Computer Science from a community college then getting a Masters in Computer Science. I’m open to suggestions. Unfortunately I don’t think there’s an official master or bachelor’s of data engineering, otherwise I’d do that. I’m not interested in management yet so an MBA is a highly unlikely. Cybersecurity is cool but I like my career in data. Maybe if there’s no other options. Thanks in advance. 

PS. This isn’t a political post. I don’t care whether people pay student loans or not, I just don’t want to pay mine yet. ",0,21,hijkblck93,2025-04-24 03:20:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k6idhk/which_degree_has_the_best_roi/,0,False,2025-04-24 03:27:49,False,False
