Need Feedback on data sharing module,"
Subject: Seeking Feedback: CrossLink - Faster Data Sharing Between Python/R/C++/Julia via Arrow & Shared Memory

Hey r/dataengineering


I've been working on a project called CrossLink aimed at tackling a common bottleneck: efficiently sharing large datasets (think multi-million row Arrow tables / Pandas DataFrames / R data.frames) between processes written in different languages (Python, R, C++, Julia) when they're running on the same machine/node.
Mainly given workflows where teams have different language expertise.

The Problem:
We often end up saving data to intermediate files (CSVs are slow, Parquet is better but still involves disk I/O and serialization/deserialization overhead) just to pass data from, say, a Python preprocessing script to an R analysis script, or a C++ simulation output to Python for plotting. This can dominate runtime for data-heavy pipelines.

CrossLink's Approach:
The idea is to create a high-performance IPC (Inter-Process Communication) layer specifically for this, leveraging:
Apache Arrow: As the common, efficient in-memory columnar format.
Shared Memory / Memory-Mapped Files: Using Arrow IPC format over these mechanisms for potential minimal-copy data transfer between processes on the same host.


DuckDB: To manage persistent metadata about the shared datasets (unique IDs, names, schemas, source language, location - shmem key or mmap path) and allow optional SQL queries across them.


Essentially, it tries to create a shared data pool where different language processes can push and pull Arrow tables with minimal overhead.


Performance:
Early benchmarks on a 100M row Python -> R pipeline are encouraging, showing CrossLink is:
Roughly 16x faster than passing data via CSV files.
Roughly 2x faster than passing data via disk-based Arrow/Parquet files.

It also now includes a streaming API with backpressure and disk-spilling capabilities for handling >RAM datasets.


Architecture:
It's built around a C++ core library (libcrosslink) handling the Arrow serialization, IPC (shmem/mmap via helper classes), and DuckDB metadata interactions. Language bindings (currently Python & R functional, Julia building) expose this functionality idiomatically.


Seeking Feedback:
I'd love to get your thoughts, especially on:
Architecture: Does using Arrow + DuckDB + (Shared Mem / MMap) seem like a reasonable approach for this problem? 

Any obvious pitfalls or complexities I might be underestimating (beyond the usual fun of shared memory management and cross-platform IPC)?


Usefulness: Is this data transfer bottleneck a significant pain point you actually encounter in your work? Would a library like CrossLink potentially fit into your workflows (e.g., local data science pipelines, multi-language services running on a single server, HPC node-local tasks)?


Alternatives: What are you currently using to handle this? (Just sticking with Parquet on shared disk? Using something like Ray's object store if you're in that ecosystem? Redis? Other IPC methods?)


Appreciate any constructive criticism or insights you might have! Happy to elaborate on any part of the design.

I built this to ease the pain of moving across different scripts and languages for a single file. Wanted to know if it useful for any of you here and would be a sensible open source project to maintain.

It is currently built only for local nodes, but looking to add support with arrow flight across nodes as well.

Beginner using API (AWS),"Hi. I work for the state and some of the tools we have are limited.

I have a gateway setup for cloud to talk to my on-premise NAS drive so auto refresh works. 

Now, my next task: I want to automate the AWS data directly from Power BI so I don’t have to log into their website each week but how do I accomplish this without a programming background? (I majored in Asian History so I don’t know much about data engineering/setting up pipelines)

I read some articles and it seems to indicate that using API can accomplish this but I don’t know Python/SDKs nor do I use CLI (I did some Powershell) and even if I do what services should I use to run CLI for me behind the scenes? Can Power BI make API calls and handle JSON?

I Want To Improve an Internal Process At My Company,"Hey r/dataengineering,

I'm currently transitioning from a software engineering role to data engineering, and I've identified a potential project at my company that I think would be a great learning experience and a chance to introduce some data engineering best practices.

Project Overview:

We have a dashboard that displays employee utilization data, sourced from two main systems: Harvest (time tracking) and Forecast (projected utilization).

Current Process:

* Harvest Data: Currently, we're using cron jobs running on an EC2 instance to periodically pull data from Harvest.
* Forecast Data: Due to the lack of an API, we're relying on Playwright (web scraping) to extract data from their web reports, which are then saved to S3.
* Data Processing: Another cron job on EC2 processes the S3 reports and loads the data into a PostgreSQL database.
* Dashboard: A custom frontend application (using Azure OAuth) queries the PostgreSQL database to display the utilization data.

Proposed Solution:

I'm proposing a serverless architecture on AWS, using the following components:

* API Gateway + Lambda: To create a robust API for our frontend application.
* Lambda for ETL: To automate data extraction, transformation, and loading from Harvest and Forecast.
* AWS Step Functions: To orchestrate the data pipeline and manage dependencies.
* Amazon RDS PostgreSQL: To serve as our data warehouse for analytical queries.

Lessons from optimizing dashboard performance on Looker Studio with BigQuery data,"We’ve been using Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio) to build reporting dashboards for digital marketing and SEO data. At first, things worked fine—but as datasets grew, dashboard performance dropped significantly.



The biggest bottlenecks were:

• Overuse of blended data sources

• Direct querying of large GA4 datasets

• Too many calculated fields applied in the visualization layer



To fix this, we adjusted our approach on the data engineering side:

• Moved most calculations (e.g., conversion rates, ROAS) to the query layer in BigQuery

• Created materialized views for campaign-level summaries

• Used scheduled queries to pre-aggregate weekly and monthly data

• Limited Looker Studio to one direct connector per dashboard and cached data where possible



Result: dashboards now load in \~3 seconds instead of 15–20, and we can scale them across accounts with minimal changes.

GizmoSQL: Power your Enterprise analytics with Arrow Flight SQL and DuckDB,"Hi! This is Phil - Founder of [GizmoData](https://gizmodata.com). We have a new commercial database engine product called: [GizmoSQL](https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql) \- built with Apache Arrow Flight SQL (for remote connectivity) and DuckDB (or optionally: SQLite) as a back-end execution engine.

This product allows you to run DuckDB or SQLite as a server (remotely) - harnessing the power of computers in the cloud - which typically have more CPUs, more memory, and faster storage (NVMe) than your laptop. In fact, running GizmoSQL on a modern arm64-based VM in Azure, GCP, or AWS allows you to run at terabyte scale - with equivalent (or better) performance - for a fraction of the cost of other popular platforms such as Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks SQL.

**GizmoSQL** is self-hosted (for now) - with a possible SaaS offering in the near future. It has these features to differentiate it from ""base"" DuckDB:

* Run DuckDB or SQLite as a server (remote connectivity)
* Concurrency - allows multiple users to work simultaneously - with independent, ACID-compliant sessions
* Security
   * Authentication
   * TLS for encryption of traffic to/from the database
* Static executable with Arrow Flight SQL, DuckDB, SQLite, and JWT-CPP built-in. There are no dependencies to install - just a single executable file to run
* Free for use in development, evaluation, and testing
* Easily containerized for running in the Cloud - especially in Kubernetes
* Easy to talk to - with ADBC, JDBC, and ODBC drivers, and now a Websocket proxy server (created by GizmoData) - so it is easy to use with javascript frameworks
   * Use it with Tableau, PowerBI, Apache Superset dashboards, and more
* Easy to work with in Python - use ADBC, or the new experimental Ibis back-end - details here: [https://github.com/gizmodata/ibis-gizmosql](https://github.com/gizmodata/ibis-gizmosql)

Because it is powered by DuckDB - GizmoSQL can work with the popular open-source data formats - such as Iceberg, Delta Lake, Parquet, and more.

GizmoSQL performs very well (when running DuckDB as its back-end execution engine) - check out our graph comparing popular SQL engines for TPC-H at scale-factor 1 Terabyte - on the homepage at: [https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql](https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql) \- there you will find it also costs far less than other options.

We would love to get your feedback on the software - it is easy to get started for free in two different ways:

* For a limited time - try GizmoSQL online on our dime - with the SQL Query Navigator - it just requires a quick registration and sign-in to get going - at: [https://app.gizmodata.com](https://app.gizmodata.com) \- where we have a read-only 1TB TPC-H database mounted for you to query in real-time. It is running on an Azure Cobalt 100 VM - with local NVMe SSD's - so it should be quite zippy.
* Download and self-host GizmoSQL - using our Docker image or executables for Linux and macOS for both x86-64 and arm64 architectures. See our README at: [https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql-public](https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql-public) for details on how to easily and quickly get started that way

Thank you for taking a look at GizmoSQL. We are excited and are glad to answer any questions you may have!

Building a Real-Time Analytics Pipeline: Balancing Throughput and Latency,"Hey everyone,

I'm designing a system to process and analyze a continuous stream of data with a focus on both high throughput and low latency. I wanted to share my proposed architecture and get your insights.

1. The core components are: **Kafka:** Serving as the central nervous system for ingesting a massive amount of data reliably.
2. **Go Processor:** A consumer application written in Go, placed directly after Kafka, to perform initial, low-latency processing and filtering of the incoming data.
3. **Intermediate Queue (Redis Streams/NATS JetStream):** To decouple the low-latency processing from the potentially slower analytics and to provide buffering for data that needs further analysis.
4. **Analytics Consumer:** Responsible for the more intensive analytical tasks on the filtered data from the queue.
5. **WebSockets:** For pushing the processed insights to a frontend in real-time.

The idea is to leverage Kafka's throughput capabilities while using Go for quick initial processing. The queue acts as a buffer and allows us to be selective about the data sent for deeper analytics. Finally, WebSockets provide the real-time link to the user.

I built this keeping in mind these three principles

* **Separation of Concerns:** Each component has a specific responsibility.
* **Scalability:** Kafka handles ingestion, and individual consumers can be scaled independently.
* **Resilience:** The queue helps decouple processing stages.

Has anyone implemented a similar architecture? What were some of the challenges and lessons learned? Any recommendations for improvements or alternative approaches?

How do you track LLM billing across multiple platforms? Looking for team management solutions,"Hi everyone,

I'm part of a team that's increasingly using multiple LLM platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc.) across different departments and projects. As our usage grows, we're struggling to effectively track and manage billing across these services.

**Current challenges:**

* Fragmented spending across multiple provider accounts
* Difficulty attributing costs to specific teams/projects
* No centralized dashboard for monitoring total LLM expenditure
* Inconsistent billing cycles between providers
* Unexpected cost spikes that are hard to trace back to specific usage

**I'd love to hear from others:**

1. What tools or systems do you use to track LLM spending across platforms?
2. How do you handle cost allocation to departments/projects?
3. Are there any third-party solutions you'd recommend for unified billing management?
4. What reporting and alerting systems work best for monitoring usage?
5. Any best practices for forecasting future LLM costs as usage scales?

A hybrid on prem and cloud based architecture?,"I am working with a customer for a use case , wherein they are would like to keep on prem for sensitive loads and cloud for non sensitive workloads . Basically they want compute and storage to be divided accordingly but ultimately the end users should one unified way of accessing data based on RBAC.

I am thinking I will suggest to go for spark on kubernetes for sensitive workloads that sits on prem and the non-sensitive goes through spark on databricks. For storage , the non sensitive data will be handled in databricks lakehouse (delta tables) but for sensitive workloads there is a preference secnumcloud storages.

Advice wanted: planning a Streamlit + DuckDB geospatial app on Azure (Web App Service + Function),"Hey all,

I’m in the design phase for a lightweight, map‑centric web app and would love a sanity check before I start provisioning Azure resources.

Proposed architecture:
- Front‑end: Streamlit container in an Azure Web App Service. It plots store/parking locations on a Leaflet/folium map.
- Back‑end: FastAPI wrapped in an Azure Function (Linux custom container). DuckDB runs inside the function.
- Data: A ~200 MB GeoParquet file in Azure Blob Storage (hot tier).
- Networking: Web App ↔ Function over VNet integration and Private Endpoints; nothing goes out to the public internet.
- Data flow: User input → Web App calls /locations → Function queries DuckDB → returns payloads.

Open questions

	1.	Function vs. always‑on container: Is a serverless Azure Function the right choice, or would something like Azure Container Apps (kept warm) be simpler for DuckDB workloads? Cold‑start worries me a bit.

	2.	Payload format: For ≤ 200 k rows, is it worth the complexity of sending Arrow/Polars over HTTP, or should I stick with plain JSON for map markers? Any real‑world gains?

	3.	Pre‑processing beyond “query from Blob”: I might need server‑side clustering, hexbin aggregation, or even vector‑tile generation to keep the payload tiny. Where would you put that logic—inside the Function, a separate batch job, or something else?

	4.	Gotchas: Security, cost surprises, deployment quirks? Anything you wish you’d known before launching a similar setup?

Interactive Change Data Capture (CDC) Playground,"I've built an interactive demo for CDC to help explain how it works.

The app currently shows the transaction log-based and query-based CDC approaches.

Change Data Capture (CDC) is a design pattern that tracks changes (inserts, updates, deletes) in a database and makes those changes available to downstream systems in real-time or near real-time.

CDC is super useful for a variety of use cases:

\- Real-time data replication between operational databases and data warehouses or lakehouses

\- Keeping analytics systems up to date without full batch reloads

\- Synchronizing data across microservices or distributed systems

\- Feeding event-driven architectures by turning database changes into event streams

\- Maintaining materialized views or derived tables with fresh data

\- Simplifying ETL/ELT pipelines by processing only changed records

A dbt column lineage visualization tool (with dynamic web visualization),"Hey dbt folks,

I'm a data engineer and use dbt on a day-to-day basis, my team and I were struggling to find a good open-source tool for user-friendly column-level lineage visualization that we could use daily, similar to what commercial solutions like dbt Cloud offer. So, I decided to start building one...

https://reddit.com/link/1jnh7pu/video/wcl9lru6zure1/player

You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/Fszta/dbt-column-lineage), and the package on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/dbt-col-lineage/0.1.1/)

**Under the hood**

Basically, it works by combining dbt's manifest and catalog with some compiled SQL parsing magic (big shoutout to sqlglot!).

I've built it as a CLI, keeping the syntax similar to dbt-core, with upstream and downstream selectors.

    dbt-col-lineage --select stg_transactions.amount+ --format html

Right now, it supports:

* Interactive HTML visualizations
* DOT graph images
* Simple text output in the console

**What's next ?**

* Focus on compatibility with more SQL dialects
* Improve the parser to handle complex syntax specific to certain dialects
* Making the UI less... basic. It's kinda rough right now, plus some information could be added such as materialization type, col typing etc

Feel free to drop any feedback or open an issue on the [repo](https://github.com/Fszta/dbt-column-lineage/tree/main)! It's still super early, and any help for testing on other dialects would be awesome. It's only been tested on projects using Snowflake, DuckDB, and SQLite adapters so far.",5,0,2025-03-30 17:11:12,0,False,2025-03-30 17:15:59,False,False,2025-03-30

Building a Cloud-Based Data Pipeline for Personal Use/Learning/Projects,"I am a data/functional analyst looking to get a better grasp on 'end-to-end data management and processing' (in quotations as that's the term my direct lead used when we aligned regarding my career objectives for the year, which definitely matches with my current interests).

Given this objective, my own interest in gaining a better grasp on general principles and functions of Data Engineering (and later on, Data Science), as well as a personal project I'm looking to finish for myself/my own portfolio by the end of the year, I'm looking for a cloud-based data pipeline solution for me to spend my role's training stipend on -- though I'm willing (and allowed) to use some of my personal funds on this as well since it's both for career progression and personal fun.

I started looking for small-scale subscriptions for some of the platforms we've previously used at work (AWS, Databricks), but the consensus I've gotten is that cost-wise, I'm potentially better off with multiple smaller platforms that I can just weave together, instead of going for platforms normally designed for enterprise use. And so I come here for help!

*(Though if this is not the right community for me to ask this, please let me know where instead)*

# Budget and Scope

* Base budget is a $200 stipend from our department, which refreshes at the end of the year
* I'm willing to add another $200-300/year, if necessary
* I'm from South-East Asia (converting our local currency, in case regional pricing matters)
* I prefer platforms/solutions that come with upfront costs instead of per-pull/use costs, so that's it's easier to manage the finances involved
* Languages I'm comfortable with are Python and SQL, since these are what I mainly use for work, but willing to learn basics of new languages where necessary 
* Since I will be using my personal computer, which is not that powerful currently, I am looking for a pipeline/platform that I can use completely via cloud (including running training models) 

# Learning Objectives 

*(aka things I want my platform/s to be able to do)*

**1. Data Gathering/Ingestion/Validation/Transformation/Storage**

* Obviously not too familiar with this step currently, so I ended up lumping a bunch of them together, but essentially ETL
* In terms of data I intend to use, I have three main sources I intend to work my way through, from simple to complex: **(1)** will be starting with ingesting CSV files I get from third-party free data providers like Kaggle, **(2)** then moving on to structured databases from sports stat sites such as BBREF, before  eventually work my way to **(3)** automating data collection from publicly available video games I normally play (Dota 2, Path of Exile -- if it matters)
* I want to be able to load these into SQL tables that I can regularly query form

**2. Data Querying and Extract Cloud Storage**

* I want to then be able to set it up so that I can easily query and then store-via-cloud what I need.
* To make my intention clear, most of my work experience is with AWS Athena and S3, so I hope to get platforms that function similarly.

**3. Cloud-Based Data Processing, Machine Learning, and Visualization**

* I currently do majority of my post-query data processing and modelling locally on my work laptop on Jupyter (via the Anaconda distribution), but one of my key objectives is learning to do all of these on cloud (especially since my peronal computer I'll be using would obviously not be as powerful as what I use for work)
* I definitely prefer Notebook-like environments, so perhaps something like AWS EMR
* My main experience at this level is mainly with Python (using specific packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Numpy, Sklearn, etc.), but I'm looking to do more PySpark as well

**4. EXTRA/OPTIONAL: Dashboard Creation and Hosting**

* If I can get a platform/pipeline that will allow me to host interactive dashboards for me to just embed in my portfolio, that would be a plus, but I am very easily willing to drop this should it not fit my budget

#  Final Remarks

* Want to learn ETL, and cloud-based data processing on a personal data pipeline and processing platform/solution that also has SQL capabilities -- in line with my career and personal learning objectives for the year 
* Tried looking into personal subscriptions for 360 solutions like Databricks and AWS Sagemaker Unified Studio, but was told that for what I want I might be better off with patching together T2 solutions or something along those lines -- but I imagine this would be much more tricky to set up ",2,1,2025-03-30 14:20:16,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-30

Need help for a small website design choices,"I am working on a website whose job is to serve data from MongoDb. Just textual data in row format nothing complicated. 

This is my current setup: client sends a request to cloudfront that manages the cache and triggers a lambda for a cache miss to query from MongoDB. I also use signedurl for security purposes for each request. 

I am not an expert that but I think cloud front can handle DDoS attacks etc. Does this setup work or do I need to bring in API Gateway into the fold? I don’t have any user login etc. and no form on the website (no sql injection risk I guess). I don’t know much about network security etc but have heard horror stories of websites getting hacked etc. Hence am a bit paranoid before launching the website. 

Based on some reading, I came to the conclusion that I need to use AWS WAF + API Gateway for dynamic queries and AWS + cloud front for static pages. And lambda should be associated with API Gateway to connect with MongoDB and API Gateway does rate limiting and caching (user authentication is no big a problem here).

**The goal of SQLFlow is to bring the simplicity of DuckDB to streaming data.**

SQLFlow is a high-performance stream processing engine that simplifies building data pipelines by enabling you to define them using just SQL. Think of SQLFLow as a lightweight, modern Flink.

SQLFlow models stream-processing as SQL queries using the [DuckDB SQL dialect](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/introduction.html). Express your entire stream processing pipeline—ingestion, transformation, and enrichment—as a single SQL statement and configuration file.

Process [10's of thousands of events per second](https://sql-flow.com/docs/tutorials/clickhouse-sink) on a single machine with low memory overhead, using Python, DuckDB, Arrow and Confluent Python Client.

A dbt column lineage visualization tool (with dynamic web visualization),"Hey dbt folks,

I'm a data engineer and use dbt on a day-to-day basis, my team and I were struggling to find a good open-source tool for user-friendly column-level lineage visualization that we could use daily, similar to what commercial solutions like dbt Cloud offer. So, I decided to start building one...

https://reddit.com/link/1jnh7pu/video/wcl9lru6zure1/player

You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/Fszta/dbt-column-lineage), and the package on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/dbt-col-lineage/0.1.1/)

**Under the hood**

Basically, it works by combining dbt's manifest and catalog with some compiled SQL parsing magic (big shoutout to sqlglot!).

I've built it as a CLI, keeping the syntax similar to dbt-core, with upstream and downstream selectors.

    dbt-col-lineage --select stg_transactions.amount+ --format html

Right now, it supports:

* Interactive HTML visualizations
* DOT graph images
* Simple text output in the console

**What's next ?**

* Focus on compatibility with more SQL dialects
* Improve the parser to handle complex syntax specific to certain dialects
* Making the UI less... basic. It's kinda rough right now, plus some information could be added such as materialization type, col typing etc

Feel free to drop any feedback or open an issue on the [repo](https://github.com/Fszta/dbt-column-lineage/tree/main)! It's still super early, and any help for testing on other dialects would be awesome. It's only been tested on projects using Snowflake, DuckDB, and SQLite adapters so far.",35,3,2025-03-30 17:11:12,0,False,2025-03-30 17:15:59,False,False,2025-03-30

Building a Cloud-Based Data Pipeline for Personal Use/Learning/Projects,"I am a data/functional analyst looking to get a better grasp on 'end-to-end data management and processing' (in quotations as that's the term my direct lead used when we aligned regarding my career objectives for the year, which definitely matches with my current interests).

Given this objective, my own interest in gaining a better grasp on general principles and functions of Data Engineering (and later on, Data Science), as well as a personal project I'm looking to finish for myself/my own portfolio by the end of the year, I'm looking for a cloud-based data pipeline solution for me to spend my role's training stipend on -- though I'm willing (and allowed) to use some of my personal funds on this as well since it's both for career progression and personal fun.

I started looking for small-scale subscriptions for some of the platforms we've previously used at work (AWS, Databricks), but the consensus I've gotten is that cost-wise, I'm potentially better off with multiple smaller platforms that I can just weave together, instead of going for platforms normally designed for enterprise use. And so I come here for help!

*(Though if this is not the right community for me to ask this, please let me know where instead)*

# Budget and Scope

* Base budget is a $200 stipend from our department, which refreshes at the end of the year
* I'm willing to add another $200-300/year, if necessary
* I'm from South-East Asia (converting our local currency, in case regional pricing matters)
* I prefer platforms/solutions that come with upfront costs instead of per-pull/use costs, so that's it's easier to manage the finances involved
* Languages I'm comfortable with are Python and SQL, since these are what I mainly use for work, but willing to learn basics of new languages where necessary 
* Since I will be using my personal computer, which is not that powerful currently, I am looking for a pipeline/platform that I can use completely via cloud (including running training models) 

# Learning Objectives 

*(aka things I want my platform/s to be able to do)*

**1. Data Gathering/Ingestion/Validation/Transformation/Storage**

* Obviously not too familiar with this step currently, so I ended up lumping a bunch of them together, but essentially ETL
* In terms of data I intend to use, I have three main sources I intend to work my way through, from simple to complex: **(1)** will be starting with ingesting CSV files I get from third-party free data providers like Kaggle, **(2)** then moving on to structured databases from sports stat sites such as BBREF, before  eventually work my way to **(3)** automating data collection from publicly available video games I normally play (Dota 2, Path of Exile -- if it matters)
* I want to be able to load these into SQL tables that I can regularly query form

**2. Data Querying and Extract Cloud Storage**

* I want to then be able to set it up so that I can easily query and then store-via-cloud what I need.
* To make my intention clear, most of my work experience is with AWS Athena and S3, so I hope to get platforms that function similarly.

**3. Cloud-Based Data Processing, Machine Learning, and Visualization**

* I currently do majority of my post-query data processing and modelling locally on my work laptop on Jupyter (via the Anaconda distribution), but one of my key objectives is learning to do all of these on cloud (especially since my peronal computer I'll be using would obviously not be as powerful as what I use for work)
* I definitely prefer Notebook-like environments, so perhaps something like AWS EMR
* My main experience at this level is mainly with Python (using specific packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Numpy, Sklearn, etc.), but I'm looking to do more PySpark as well

**4. EXTRA/OPTIONAL: Dashboard Creation and Hosting**

* If I can get a platform/pipeline that will allow me to host interactive dashboards for me to just embed in my portfolio, that would be a plus, but I am very easily willing to drop this should it not fit my budget

#  Final Remarks

* Want to learn ETL, and cloud-based data processing on a personal data pipeline and processing platform/solution that also has SQL capabilities -- in line with my career and personal learning objectives for the year 
* Tried looking into personal subscriptions for 360 solutions like Databricks and AWS Sagemaker Unified Studio, but was told that for what I want I might be better off with patching together T2 solutions or something along those lines -- but I imagine this would be much more tricky to set up ",1,1,2025-03-30 14:20:16,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-30

Why is table extraction still not solved by modern multimodal models?,"There is a lot of hype around multimodal models, such as Qwen 2.5 VL or Omni, GOT, SmolDocling, etc. I would like to know if others made a similar experience in practice: While they can do impressive things, they still struggle with table extraction, in cases which are straight-forward for humans.

Attached is a simple example, all I need is a reconstruction of the table as a flat CSV, preserving empty all empty cells correctly. Which open source model is able to do that?

Prefect - too expensive?,"Hey guys,
we’re currently using self-hosted Airflow for our internal ETL and data workflows. It gets the job done, but I never really liked it. Feels too far away from actual Python, gets overly complex at times, and local development and testing is honestly a nightmare.

I recently stumbled upon Prefect and gave the self-hosted version a try. Really liked what I saw. Super Pythonic, easy to set up locally, modern UI - just felt right from the start.

But the problem is: the open-source version doesn’t offer user management or logging, so we’d need the Cloud version. Pricing would be around 30k USD per year, which is way above what we pay for Airflow. Even with a discount, it would still be too much for us.

Is there any way to make the community version work for a small team? Usermanagement and Audit-Logs is definitely a must for us. Or is Prefect just not realistic without going Cloud?

Would be a shame, because I really liked their approach.

If not Prefect, any tips on making Airflow easier for local dev and testing?",41,47,2025-03-31 10:26:08,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-31 10:26:08,10,Monday,183.0,1036,66.74,14,264,9.8,0,0,NEGATIVE,-0.9288020133972168,"['hey', 'guys', 'currently', 'using', 'selfhosted', 'airflow', 'internal', 'etl', 'data', 'workflows', 'gets', 'job', 'done', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'feels', 'far', 'away', 'actual', 'python', 'gets', 'overly', 'complex', 'times', 'local', 'development', 'testing', 'honestly', 'nightmare', 'recently', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'prefect', 'gave', 'selfhosted', 'version', 'try', 'really', 'liked', 'saw', 'super', 'pythonic', 'easy', 'set', 'locally', 'modern', 'felt', 'right', 'start', 'problem', 'opensource', 'version', 'doesnt', 'offer', 'user', 'management', 'logging', 'wed', 'need', 'cloud', 'version', 'pricing', 'would', 'around', 'usd', 'per', 'year', 'way', 'pay', 'airflow', 'even', 'discount', 'would', 'still', 'much', 'way', 'make', 'community', 'version', 'work', 'small', 'team', 'usermanagement', 'auditlogs', 'definitely', 'must', 'prefect', 'realistic', 'without', 'going', 'cloud', 'would', 'shame', 'really', 'liked', 'approach', 'prefect', 'tips', 'making', 'airflow', 'easier', 'local', 'dev', 'testing']",hey guys currently using selfhosted airflow internal etl data workflows gets job done never really liked feels far away actual python gets overly complex times local development testing honestly nightmare recently stumbled upon prefect gave selfhosted version try really liked saw super pythonic easy set locally modern felt right start problem opensource version doesnt offer user management logging wed need cloud version pricing would around usd per year way pay airflow even discount would still much way make community version work small team usermanagement auditlogs definitely must prefect realistic without going cloud would shame really liked approach prefect tips making airflow easier local dev testing,High,1,1,"data, like, use, would, get, want, new, also, way, make, etc, something, better, one, help, snowflake, databricks, lot, best, find, team, build, think, used, seems, might, process, able, done, solution, code, approach, right, google, start, since, instead, many, another, big, everything, thats, multiple, questions, however, similar, redshift, part, wondering, two, model, youre, based, tried, problem, understand, open, easy, whats, teams, maybe, real, sources, idea, tests, full, issues, stuff, try, useful, within, product, functions, next, implement, various, thinking, high, creating, version, hope, basically, input, step, options, context, fit, production, super, moving, drop, reports, pay, worth, community, related, search, sense, lake, documentation, quality, struggling, following, comes, modeling, makes, helps, results, clean, test, several, gets, limited, important, structures, early, thought, prefer, pricing, necessary, base, apply, delta, whole, side, ways, considering, task, along, whether, certain, put, group, learned, place, fivetran, plan, plus, internal, definitely, asked, pain, git, migrate, guidance, keeping, saas, entire, involves, lineage, client, looks, couple, considered, value, heres, regarding, writing, ingesting, control, arent, top, ideally, syntax, expensive, downstream, ideas, evolve, facing, rather, total, online, initial, windows, adf, mean, painful, personally, behind, expect, sample, tested, required, explore, huge, warehouses, somewhere, website, purpose, hit, topic, present, risk, implementing, relevant, wasnt, consider, infrastructure, replace, low, cons, practical, mechanism, party, bad, observability, identify, scraping, marketing, fix, vendor, replication, entry, approaches, sort, inputs, wed, logging, zero, somehow, email, written, designed, normally, pass, ease, perhaps, medallion, benchmark, nothing, engagement, non, choice, mess, recovery, steps, customer, failed, standard, amount, tsql, servers, needing, optimizing, extra, lists, lately, obvious, visual, matching, showing, clients, play, powerbi, problems, businesses, legacy, implementation, relying, automation, magic, decided, stat, eventually, automating, scala",7.7,7.0,150.9,-0.663,921.0,50.8,8.5,225.4,9.7,21.4,16.7,83,183,70,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

Is using Snowflake for near real time or hourly events an overkill ?,"I've been using Snowflake for a while for just data warehousing projects (analytics) where I update the data twice per day.

  
I have now a Use Case where I need to do some reads and writes to sql tables every hour (every 10 min would be even better but not necessary). **The purpose is not only analytics but also operational.**

  
I estimate every request **costs me 0.01$,** which is quite high.

I was thinking of using **Postgresql** instead of Snowflake but I will need to invest time and resources to build it and maintain it. 

  
I was wondering if you can give me **your opinion** about building **near real time or hourly projects** in Snowflake. Does it make sense ? or is it a clear no-go ?

Asking for different tools for SQL Server + SSIS project.,"Hello guys. I work in a consultancy company and we recently got a job to set-up SQL Server as DWH and SSIS. Whole system is going to be build up from the scratch. The whole operation of the company was running on Excel spreadsheets with 20+ Excel Slave that copies and pastes some data from a source, CSV or email then presses the fancy refresh button. Company newly bought and they want to get rid of this stupid shit so SQL Server and SSIS combo is a huge improvement for them (lol).

But I want to integrate as much as fancy stuff in this project. Both of these tool will work on a Remote Desktop with no internet connection.  I want to integrate some DevOps tools into this project. I will be one of the 3 data engineers that is going to work on this project. So Git will be definitely on my list, as well as GitTea or a repo that works offline since there won't be a lot of people. But do you have any more free tools that I can use? Planning to integrate Jenkins in offline mode somehow, tsqlt for unit testing seems like a decent choice as well. dbt-core and airflow was on my list as well but my colleagues don't know any python so they are not gonna be on this list.

Operating systems and hardware available for employees in your company,"Hey guys,

I'm working as a DE in a German IT company that has about 500 employees. The company's policy regarding operating systems the employees are allowed to use is strange and unfair (IMO). All software engineers get access to Macbooks and thus, to MacOS while all other employees that have a differnt job title ""only"" get HP elite books (that are not elite at all) that run on Windows. WSL is allowed but a native Linux is not accepted because of security reasons (I don't know which security reasons).

As far as I know the company does not want other job positions to get Macbooks because the whole updating stuff for those Macbooks  is done by an external company which is quite expensive. The Windows laptops instead are maintained by an internal team.

A lot of people are very unhappy with this situation because many of them (including me) would prefer to use Linux or MacOS. Especially all DevOps are pissed because half a year ago they also got access to MacBooks but a change in the policy means that they will have to change back to Windows laptops once their MacBooks break or become too old.

My question(s): Can you choose the OS and/or hardware in your company? Do you have a clue why Linux may not be accepted? Is it really not that safe (which I cannot think of because the company has it's own data center where a lot of Linux servers run that are actually updated by an internal team)?",2,11,2025-03-31 17:48:33,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-31 17:48:33,17,Monday,255.0,1410,56.39,11,375,12.9,0,0,NEGATIVE,-0.9994255304336548,"['hey', 'guys', 'working', 'german', 'company', 'employees', 'companys', 'policy', 'regarding', 'operating', 'systems', 'employees', 'allowed', 'use', 'strange', 'unfair', 'imo', 'software', 'engineers', 'get', 'access', 'macbooks', 'thus', 'macos', 'employees', 'differnt', 'job', 'title', 'get', 'elite', 'books', 'elite', 'run', 'windows', 'wsl', 'allowed', 'native', 'linux', 'accepted', 'security', 'reasons', 'dont', 'know', 'security', 'reasons', 'far', 'know', 'company', 'want', 'job', 'positions', 'get', 'macbooks', 'whole', 'updating', 'stuff', 'macbooks', 'done', 'external', 'company', 'quite', 'expensive', 'windows', 'laptops', 'instead', 'maintained', 'internal', 'team', 'lot', 'people', 'unhappy', 'situation', 'many', 'including', 'would', 'prefer', 'use', 'linux', 'macos', 'especially', 'devops', 'pissed', 'half', 'year', 'ago', 'also', 'got', 'access', 'macbooks', 'change', 'policy', 'means', 'change', 'back', 'windows', 'laptops', 'macbooks', 'break', 'become', 'old', 'questions', 'choose', 'andor', 'hardware', 'company', 'clue', 'linux', 'may', 'accepted', 'really', 'safe', 'cannot', 'think', 'company', 'data', 'center', 'lot', 'linux', 'servers', 'run', 'actually', 'updated', 'internal', 'team']",hey guys working german company employees companys policy regarding operating systems employees allowed use strange unfair imo software engineers get access macbooks thus macos employees differnt job title get elite books elite run windows wsl allowed native linux accepted security reasons dont know security reasons far know company want job positions get macbooks whole updating stuff macbooks done external company quite expensive windows laptops instead maintained internal team lot people unhappy situation many including would prefer use linux macos especially devops pissed half year ago also got access macbooks change policy means change back windows laptops macbooks break become old questions choose andor hardware company clue linux may accepted really safe cannot think company data center lot linux servers run actually updated internal team,Mid,1,1,"data, like, use, would, get, want, new, also, way, make, etc, something, better, one, help, snowflake, databricks, lot, best, find, team, build, think, used, seems, might, process, able, done, solution, code, approach, right, google, start, since, instead, many, another, big, everything, thats, multiple, questions, however, similar, redshift, part, wondering, two, model, youre, based, tried, problem, understand, open, easy, whats, teams, maybe, real, sources, idea, tests, full, issues, stuff, try, useful, within, product, functions, next, implement, various, thinking, high, creating, version, hope, basically, input, step, options, context, fit, production, super, moving, drop, reports, pay, worth, community, related, search, sense, lake, documentation, quality, struggling, following, comes, modeling, makes, helps, results, clean, test, several, gets, limited, important, structures, early, thought, prefer, pricing, necessary, base, apply, delta, whole, side, ways, considering, task, along, whether, certain, put, group, learned, place, fivetran, plan, plus, internal, definitely, asked, pain, git, migrate, guidance, keeping, saas, entire, involves, lineage, client, looks, couple, considered, value, heres, regarding, writing, ingesting, control, arent, top, ideally, syntax, expensive, downstream, ideas, evolve, facing, rather, total, online, initial, windows, adf, mean, painful, personally, behind, expect, sample, tested, required, explore, huge, warehouses, somewhere, website, purpose, hit, topic, present, risk, implementing, relevant, wasnt, consider, infrastructure, replace, low, cons, practical, mechanism, party, bad, observability, identify, scraping, marketing, fix, vendor, replication, entry, approaches, sort, inputs, wed, logging, zero, somehow, email, written, designed, normally, pass, ease, perhaps, medallion, benchmark, nothing, engagement, non, choice, mess, recovery, steps, customer, failed, standard, amount, tsql, servers, needing, optimizing, extra, lists, lately, obvious, visual, matching, showing, clients, play, powerbi, problems, businesses, legacy, implementation, relying, automation, magic, decided, stat, eventually, automating, scala",7.7,7.0,150.9,-0.663,921.0,50.8,8.5,225.4,9.7,21.4,16.7,83,183,70,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

How do I manage dev/test/prod when using Unity Catalog for Medallion Architecture with dbt?,"Hi everyone,

I'm in the process of setting up a dbt project on Databricks and planning to leverage Unity Catalog to implement a medallion architecture. I am not sure the correct approach.  I am considering a dev/test/prod catalog, with a bronze/silver/gold schema:

* dev.bronze
* test.bronze
* prod.bronze

However, this takes 2 of the namespaces so all of the other information has to live in a single namespace such as table type (dim/fact), department (hr/finance), and data source and table description.  It seems like a lot to cram in there.

I have used the medallion architecture as a guide, but never used it in the naming, but the current team I am on really wants it to be in the name.  Just wondering what approaches people have taken.

Question about preprocessing two time-series datasets from different measurement devices,"I have a question regarding the preprocessing step in a project I'm working on. I have two different measurement devices that both collect time-series data. My goal is to analyze the similarity between these two signals.

Although both devices measure the same phenomenon and I've converted the units to be consistent, I'm unsure whether this is sufficient for meaningful comparison, given that the devices themselves are different and may have distinct ranges or variances.

From the literature, I’ve found that z-score normalization is commonly used to address such issues. However, I’m concerned that applying z-score normalization to each dataset individually might make it impossible to compare across datasets, especially when I want to analyze multiple sessions or subjects later.

Is z-score normalization the right approach in this case? Or would it be better to normalize using a common reference (e.g., using statistics from a larger dataset)? Any guidance or references would be greatly appreciated.Thank you :)",1,1,2025-03-31 02:33:18,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-31 02:33:18,2,Monday,156.0,1023,47.28,10,266,13.0,0,0,NEGATIVE,-0.9945716261863708,"['question', 'regarding', 'preprocessing', 'step', 'project', 'working', 'two', 'different', 'measurement', 'devices', 'collect', 'timeseries', 'data', 'goal', 'analyze', 'similarity', 'two', 'signals', 'although', 'devices', 'measure', 'phenomenon', 'ive', 'converted', 'units', 'consistent', 'unsure', 'whether', 'sufficient', 'meaningful', 'comparison', 'given', 'devices', 'different', 'may', 'distinct', 'ranges', 'variances', 'literature', 'ive', 'found', 'zscore', 'normalization', 'commonly', 'used', 'address', 'issues', 'however', 'concerned', 'applying', 'zscore', 'normalization', 'dataset', 'individually', 'might', 'make', 'impossible', 'compare', 'across', 'datasets', 'especially', 'want', 'analyze', 'multiple', 'sessions', 'subjects', 'later', 'zscore', 'normalization', 'right', 'approach', 'case', 'would', 'better', 'normalize', 'using', 'common', 'reference', 'using', 'statistics', 'larger', 'dataset', 'guidance', 'references', 'would', 'greatly', 'appreciatedthank']",question regarding preprocessing step project working two different measurement devices collect timeseries data goal analyze similarity two signals although devices measure phenomenon ive converted units consistent unsure whether sufficient meaningful comparison given devices different may distinct ranges variances literature ive found zscore normalization commonly used address issues however concerned applying zscore normalization dataset individually might make impossible compare across datasets especially want analyze multiple sessions subjects later zscore normalization right approach case would better normalize using common reference using statistics larger dataset guidance references would greatly appreciatedthank,Mid,1,1,"data, like, use, would, get, want, new, also, way, make, etc, something, better, one, help, snowflake, databricks, lot, best, find, team, build, think, used, seems, might, process, able, done, solution, code, approach, right, google, start, since, instead, many, another, big, everything, thats, multiple, questions, however, similar, redshift, part, wondering, two, model, youre, based, tried, problem, understand, open, easy, whats, teams, maybe, real, sources, idea, tests, full, issues, stuff, try, useful, within, product, functions, next, implement, various, thinking, high, creating, version, hope, basically, input, step, options, context, fit, production, super, moving, drop, reports, pay, worth, community, related, search, sense, lake, documentation, quality, struggling, following, comes, modeling, makes, helps, results, clean, test, several, gets, limited, important, structures, early, thought, prefer, pricing, necessary, base, apply, delta, whole, side, ways, considering, task, along, whether, certain, put, group, learned, place, fivetran, plan, plus, internal, definitely, asked, pain, git, migrate, guidance, keeping, saas, entire, involves, lineage, client, looks, couple, considered, value, heres, regarding, writing, ingesting, control, arent, top, ideally, syntax, expensive, downstream, ideas, evolve, facing, rather, total, online, initial, windows, adf, mean, painful, personally, behind, expect, sample, tested, required, explore, huge, warehouses, somewhere, website, purpose, hit, topic, present, risk, implementing, relevant, wasnt, consider, infrastructure, replace, low, cons, practical, mechanism, party, bad, observability, identify, scraping, marketing, fix, vendor, replication, entry, approaches, sort, inputs, wed, logging, zero, somehow, email, written, designed, normally, pass, ease, perhaps, medallion, benchmark, nothing, engagement, non, choice, mess, recovery, steps, customer, failed, standard, amount, tsql, servers, needing, optimizing, extra, lists, lately, obvious, visual, matching, showing, clients, play, powerbi, problems, businesses, legacy, implementation, relying, automation, magic, decided, stat, eventually, automating, scala",7.7,7.0,150.9,-0.663,921.0,50.8,8.5,225.4,9.7,21.4,16.7,83,183,70,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

~33% faster Microsoft Fabric with e6data– Feedback Requested,"Hey folks,

I'm a data engineer at [e6data](https://www.e6data.com/), and we've been working on integrating our engine with Microsoft Fabric. We recently ran some benchmarks (TPC-DS) and observed around a **33% improvement in SQL query performance** while also significantly reducing costs compared to native Fabric compute engines.

Here's what our integration specifically enables:

* **33% faster SQL queries** directly on data stored in OneLake (TPC-DS benchmark results).
* **2-3x cost reduction** by optimizing compute efficiency.
* **Zero data movement**: direct querying of data from OneLake.
* Native vector search support for AI-driven workflows.
* Scalable to 1000+ QPS with sub-second latency and real-time autoscaling.
* Enterprise-level security measures.

We've documented our approach and benchmark results: [https://www.e6data.com/blog/e6data-fabric-increased-performance-optimized-capacity](https://www.e6data.com/blog/e6data-fabric-increased-performance-optimized-capacity)

We'd genuinely appreciate your thoughts, feedback, or questions about our approach or experiences with similar integrations.

"Career improves, but projects don't? [discussion]","I started 6 years ago and my career has been on a growing trajectory since.

While this is very nice for me, I can’t say the same about the projects I encounter. What I mean is that I was expecting the engineering soundness of the projects I encounter to grow alongside my seniority in this field.

Instead, I’ve found that regardless of where I end up (the last two companies were data consulting shops), the projects I am assigned to tend to have questionable engineering decisions (often involving an unnecessary use of Spark to move 7 rows of data).

The latest one involves ETL out of MSSQL and into object storage, using a combination of Azure synapse spark notebooks, drag and drop GUI pipelines, absolutely no tests or CICD whatsoever, and debatable modeling once data lands in the lake.

This whole thing scares me quite a lot due to the lack of guardrails, while testing and deployments are done manually. While I'd love to rewrite everything from scratch, my eng lead said since that part it's complete and there isn't a plan to change it in the future, that it's not a priority at all, and I agree with this.

What's your experience in situations like this? How do you juggle the competing priorities (client wanting new things vs. optimizing old stuff etc...)?

Facebook Marketing API - Anyone have a successful ETL experience?,"We have a python integration set up where we pull data from Google Ads and Facebook Marketing into our data warehouse. We're pulling data about all 3 hierarchy tiers and some daily metrics:

1. Campaigns (id, name, start time, stop time)
2. Ad Groups/Ad Sets (id, name)
3. Ads (id, name, URL)
4. Metrics (clicks, impressions, spend) for the previous day

For the Google Ads API, you basically send a SQL query and the return time is like a tenth of a second.

For Facebook, we see returns times in the minutes, especially on the Ads piece. Was hoping to get an idea of how others might have successfully set up a process to get this data from Facebook in a more timely fashion, and possibly without hitting the rate limiting threshold.

Not the exact code we're using - I can get it off my work system tomorrow - but the gist:

    from facebook_business.adobjects.adaccount import AdAccount
    from facebook_business.adobjects.campaign import Campaign
    from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import AdSet
    from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import Ad
    from facebook_business.adobjects.adcreative import AdCreative
    campaigns = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_campaigns(
        params={},
        fields=[Campaign.Field.id,Campaign.Field.name,Campaign.Field.start_time,Campaign.Field.stop_time]
    )
    adsets= AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_sets(
        params={},
        fields=[AdSet.Field.id,AdSet.Field.name]
    )
    ads = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ads(
        params={},
        fields=[Ad.Field.id,Ad.Field.name,Ad.Field.creative]
    )
    object_urls = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_creatives(
        params={},
        fields=[AdCreative.Field.object_story_spec]
    )
    asset_urls = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_creatives(
        params={},
        fields=[AdCreative.Field.asset_feed_spec]
    )

We then have to do some joining between ads/object\_urls/asset\_urls to match the Ad with the destination URL if the ad is clicked on.

The performance is so slow, that I hope we are doing it wrong. I was never able to get the batch call to work and I'm not sure how to improve things.

ELI5 - High-Level Diagram of a Data Strategy,"Hello everyone! 

I am not a data engineer, but I am trying to help other people within my organization (as well as myself) get a better understanding of what an overall data strategy looks like.  So, I figured I would ask the experts.    

**Do you have a go-to high-level diagram you use that simplifies the complexities of an overall data solution and helps you communicate what that should look like to non-technical people like myself?** 

I’m a very visual learner so seeing something that shows what the journey of data should look like from beginning to end would be extremely helpful.  I’ve searched online but almost everything I see is created by a vendor trying to show why their product is better.  I’d much rather see an unbiased explanation of what the overall process should be and then layer in vendor choices later.

I apologize if the question is phrased incorrectly or too vague.  If clarifying questions/answers are needed, please let me know and I’ll do my best to answer them.  Thanks in advance for your help.",1,0,2025-04-01 16:58:49,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-01 16:58:49,16,Tuesday,177.0,1033,59.94,9,270,12.1,0,1,POSITIVE,0.9941459894180298,"['hello', 'everyone', 'data', 'engineer', 'trying', 'help', 'people', 'within', 'organization', 'well', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'overall', 'data', 'strategy', 'looks', 'like', 'figured', 'would', 'ask', 'experts', 'goto', 'highlevel', 'diagram', 'use', 'simplifies', 'complexities', 'overall', 'data', 'solution', 'helps', 'communicate', 'look', 'like', 'nontechnical', 'people', 'like', 'visual', 'learner', 'seeing', 'something', 'shows', 'journey', 'data', 'look', 'like', 'beginning', 'end', 'would', 'extremely', 'helpful', 'ive', 'searched', 'online', 'almost', 'everything', 'see', 'created', 'vendor', 'trying', 'show', 'product', 'better', 'much', 'rather', 'see', 'unbiased', 'explanation', 'overall', 'process', 'layer', 'vendor', 'choices', 'later', 'apologize', 'question', 'phrased', 'incorrectly', 'vague', 'clarifying', 'questionsanswers', 'needed', 'please', 'let', 'know', 'ill', 'best', 'answer', 'thanks', 'advance', 'help']",hello everyone data engineer trying help people within organization well get better understanding overall data strategy looks like figured would ask experts goto highlevel diagram use simplifies complexities overall data solution helps communicate look like nontechnical people like visual learner seeing something shows journey data look like beginning end would extremely helpful ive searched online almost everything see created vendor trying show product better much rather see unbiased explanation overall process layer vendor choices later apologize question phrased incorrectly vague clarifying questionsanswers needed please let know ill best answer thanks advance help,Mid,1,1,"data, like, use, would, get, want, new, also, way, make, etc, something, better, one, help, snowflake, databricks, lot, best, find, team, build, think, used, seems, might, process, able, done, solution, code, approach, right, google, start, since, instead, many, another, big, everything, thats, multiple, questions, however, similar, redshift, part, wondering, two, model, youre, based, tried, problem, understand, open, easy, whats, teams, maybe, real, sources, idea, tests, full, issues, stuff, try, useful, within, product, functions, next, implement, various, thinking, high, creating, version, hope, basically, input, step, options, context, fit, production, super, moving, drop, reports, pay, worth, community, related, search, sense, lake, documentation, quality, struggling, following, comes, modeling, makes, helps, results, clean, test, several, gets, limited, important, structures, early, thought, prefer, pricing, necessary, base, apply, delta, whole, side, ways, considering, task, along, whether, certain, put, group, learned, place, fivetran, plan, plus, internal, definitely, asked, pain, git, migrate, guidance, keeping, saas, entire, involves, lineage, client, looks, couple, considered, value, heres, regarding, writing, ingesting, control, arent, top, ideally, syntax, expensive, downstream, ideas, evolve, facing, rather, total, online, initial, windows, adf, mean, painful, personally, behind, expect, sample, tested, required, explore, huge, warehouses, somewhere, website, purpose, hit, topic, present, risk, implementing, relevant, wasnt, consider, infrastructure, replace, low, cons, practical, mechanism, party, bad, observability, identify, scraping, marketing, fix, vendor, replication, entry, approaches, sort, inputs, wed, logging, zero, somehow, email, written, designed, normally, pass, ease, perhaps, medallion, benchmark, nothing, engagement, non, choice, mess, recovery, steps, customer, failed, standard, amount, tsql, servers, needing, optimizing, extra, lists, lately, obvious, visual, matching, showing, clients, play, powerbi, problems, businesses, legacy, implementation, relying, automation, magic, decided, stat, eventually, automating, scala",7.7,7.0,150.9,-0.663,921.0,50.8,8.5,225.4,9.7,21.4,16.7,83,183,70,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

Dimensional modelling -> Datetime column,"Hi All,

Im learning Dimensional modelling. Im working on the NYC taxi dataset ( [here is the data dictionary](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf) ).

Im struggling to model Datetime columns: tpep\_pickup\_datetime, tpep\_dropoff\_datetime.  
Does these columns should be in Dimensions table or in Fact table? 

What I understand from the Kimball datawarehouse toolkit book is to have a DateDim table populated with dates from start\_date to end\_date with details like month, year, quarter, day of week etc. but what about timestamp?

Lets say if I want to see the data for certain time of the day like nights? In this case, do I need to split the columns: tpep\_pickup\_datetime, tpep\_dropoff\_datetime into date, hour, mins in fact table and join to a dim table with the timestamp details like hour, mins etc? ( so two dim tables - date and timestamp )

It would be great someone can help me here?",1,2,2025-04-01 15:21:53,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-01 15:21:53,15,Tuesday,145.0,951,55.64,9,217,9.4,1,0,NEGATIVE,-0.9994295239448547,"['learning', 'dimensional', 'modelling', 'working', 'nyc', 'taxi', 'dataset', 'data', 'dictionaryhttpswwwnycgovassetstlcdownloadspdfdatadictionarytriprecordsyellowpdf', 'struggling', 'model', 'datetime', 'columns', 'tpeppickupdatetime', 'tpepdropoffdatetime', 'columns', 'dimensions', 'table', 'fact', 'table', 'understand', 'kimball', 'datawarehouse', 'toolkit', 'book', 'datedim', 'table', 'populated', 'dates', 'startdate', 'enddate', 'details', 'like', 'month', 'year', 'quarter', 'day', 'week', 'etc', 'timestamp', 'lets', 'say', 'want', 'see', 'data', 'certain', 'time', 'day', 'like', 'nights', 'case', 'need', 'split', 'columns', 'tpeppickupdatetime', 'tpepdropoffdatetime', 'date', 'hour', 'mins', 'fact', 'table', 'join', 'dim', 'table', 'timestamp', 'details', 'like', 'hour', 'mins', 'etc', 'two', 'dim', 'tables', 'date', 'timestamp', 'would', 'great', 'someone', 'help']",learning dimensional modelling working nyc taxi dataset data dictionaryhttpswwwnycgovassetstlcdownloadspdfdatadictionarytriprecordsyellowpdf struggling model datetime columns tpeppickupdatetime tpepdropoffdatetime columns dimensions table fact table understand kimball datawarehouse toolkit book datedim table populated dates startdate enddate details like month year quarter day week etc timestamp lets say want see data certain time day like nights case need split columns tpeppickupdatetime tpepdropoffdatetime date hour mins fact table join dim table timestamp details like hour mins etc two dim tables date timestamp would great someone help,Mid,1,1,"data, like, use, would, get, want, new, also, way, make, etc, something, better, one, help, snowflake, databricks, lot, best, find, team, build, think, used, seems, might, process, able, done, solution, code, approach, right, google, start, since, instead, many, another, big, everything, thats, multiple, questions, however, similar, redshift, part, wondering, two, model, youre, based, tried, problem, understand, open, easy, whats, teams, maybe, real, sources, idea, tests, full, issues, stuff, try, useful, within, product, functions, next, implement, various, thinking, high, creating, version, hope, basically, input, step, options, context, fit, production, super, moving, drop, reports, pay, worth, community, related, search, sense, lake, documentation, quality, struggling, following, comes, modeling, makes, helps, results, clean, test, several, gets, limited, important, structures, early, thought, prefer, pricing, necessary, base, apply, delta, whole, side, ways, considering, task, along, whether, certain, put, group, learned, place, fivetran, plan, plus, internal, definitely, asked, pain, git, migrate, guidance, keeping, saas, entire, involves, lineage, client, looks, couple, considered, value, heres, regarding, writing, ingesting, control, arent, top, ideally, syntax, expensive, downstream, ideas, evolve, facing, rather, total, online, initial, windows, adf, mean, painful, personally, behind, expect, sample, tested, required, explore, huge, warehouses, somewhere, website, purpose, hit, topic, present, risk, implementing, relevant, wasnt, consider, infrastructure, replace, low, cons, practical, mechanism, party, bad, observability, identify, scraping, marketing, fix, vendor, replication, entry, approaches, sort, inputs, wed, logging, zero, somehow, email, written, designed, normally, pass, ease, perhaps, medallion, benchmark, nothing, engagement, non, choice, mess, recovery, steps, customer, failed, standard, amount, tsql, servers, needing, optimizing, extra, lists, lately, obvious, visual, matching, showing, clients, play, powerbi, problems, businesses, legacy, implementation, relying, automation, magic, decided, stat, eventually, automating, scala",7.7,7.0,150.9,-0.663,921.0,50.8,8.5,225.4,9.7,21.4,16.7,83,183,70,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

Newbie to DE needs help with the approach to the architecture of a project,"So I was hired as a data analyst a few months ago and I have a background in software development. A few months ago I was moved to a smallish project with the objective of streamlining some administrative tasks that were all calculated ""manually"" with Excel.  By the time, all I had worked with were very basic, low code tools from the Microsoft enviroment: PBI for dashboards, Power Automate, Power Apps for data entry, Sharepoint lists, etc, so that's what I used to set it up. 

The cost for the client is basically nonexistent right now, apart from a couple of PBI licenses. The closest I've done to ETL work has been with power query, if you can even call it that. 

  
Now I'm at a point where it feels like that's not gonna cut it anymore. I'm going to be working with larger volumes of data, with more complex relationships between tables and transformations that need to be done earlier in the process. I could technically keep going with what I have but I want to actually build something durable and move towards actual data engineering, but I don't know where to start with a solution that's cost efficient and well structured. For example, I wanted to move the data from Sharepoint lists to a proper database but then we'd have to pay for multiple premium licenses to be able to connect to them in powerapps. Where do I even start?

I know the very basics of data engineering and I've done a couple of tutorial projects with Snowflake and Databricks as my team seems to want to focus on cloud based solutions. So I'm not starting from absolute scratch, but I feel pretty lost as I'm sure you can tell. I'd appreciate any kind of advice or input as to where to head from here, as I'm on my own right now.",0,4,2025-04-01 11:00:15,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-01

Skills to Stay Relevant in Data Engineering Over the Next 5-10 Years,"Hey r/dataengineering,

I've been in data engineering for about **3 years now**, and while I love what I do, I can't help but wonder: **what’s next?** With tech evolving so fast, I'm a bit concerned about what could make our current skills obsolete.

That said, Spark didn’t exactly kill the demand for Hadoop, Impala, etc.—so maybe the fear is overblown. But still, I want to make sure I'm **learning the right things** to stay ahead and not be caught off guard by layoffs or major shifts in the industry.

"New to Data Engineering — Feeling a Bit Overwhelmed, Looking for Advice","Hey everyone, I could really use some advice from fellow engineers. I'm pretty new to the data world — I messed up uni, then did an online analytics course, and after about a year and a half of grinding, I finally landed my first role. Along the way, I found a real passion for Python and SQL.

My first job involved a ton of patchy reporting because of messy infra and data. I started automating painful tasks using basic ETL pipelines I built myself. I showed an interest in APIs and, out of nowhere, 6 months in, I was offered a data engineering role.

Fast forward to now — I’ve been in the new role for a month, and I’m the company’s only data engineer. I’m doing a data engineering apprenticeship at the same time, which helps, but the imposter syndrome is real. The company’s been limping along with a 25-year-old piece of software that populates our SQL Server DB, and we’re now migrating to something new. I’ve been asked to learn MuleSoft for ETL and replace some existing pipelines that were built in Python.

I love the subject — I’m genuinely passionate about programming and networking — and I’m keen to take on new tech, improve the infra, and build up strong skills. But I’m not sure if I’m going too deep too fast. For example, today I was learning Docker to deploy Python scripts, just to avoid issues with hundreds of brittle batch files that break if we update Python.

My boss seems to think MuleSoft will fully replace Python, but I see it more as a tool that complements certain workflows rather than a full replacement. What worries me more is that I don’t really have any technical peers. Most people in my team only know basic SQL, and it’s hard to communicate strategy or get proper feedback.

My current priorities are getting comfortable with MuleSoft, Git, and Docker. I’m constantly learning, but sometimes I leave work feeling overwhelmed. There’s so much broken or duct-taped together, I don’t even know where to start. I keep telling myself I don’t need to “save the world,” but I really want to do a good job and come away with solid experience.

Long term, they want to deploy this new software, rebuild the database, and eventually use AI to help employees query the business. There’s a shit ton to do, and I’m still figuring out basics — like setting up a VM just so I can run Docker.

Am I jumping the gun with how I’m feeling, or is this as wild a situation as it seems? Any advice for a new engineer navigating bad infra, limited support, and a mountain of work would be seriously appreciated.",8,3,2025-04-02 19:27:27,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-02

Suggestions for workflow automation,"Hey there :)

  
I hope I find myself in the right subreddit for this as I am trying to **engineer** my computer to push around some **data** ;) 

I'm currently working on a project to fully automate the processing of test results for a scientific study with students. 

The workflow consists of several stages:

1. **Data Extraction:** The test data is extracted from a local SQL database.
2. **SPSS Processing:** The extracted data is then processed using SPSS with a custom-built syntax (legacy). This step generates multiple files from the data. I have been looking into how I can transition this syntax to a python script, so this step might be cut later.
3. **Python Automation:** A Python script takes over the further processing. It reads the files, splits the data per class, inserts it into pre-designed Excel reporting templates.
4. **File Upload:** The files are then automatically uploaded to a self-hosted Nextcloud instance.
5. **Notification:** Once the workflow is complete, a notification  

I have been thinking about different ways to implement this. Right now the inputs and outputs for the different steps are still done manually. 

At work I have been using Jenkins lately and I think it feels natural  to do it in Jenkins and just describe the whole workflow in a pipeline with different stages to run. Besides that I have some experience with AWS Lambda and n8n but I am not sure if they would be helpful with this task.

I´m not that experienced setting up such workflows as my work background is more in Infosec, so please forgive my uneducated guesses about how I best go about this :D Just trying not to take decisions that will be problematic later.

Facebook Marketing API - Anyone have a successful ETL experience?,"We have a python integration set up where we pull data from Google Ads and Facebook Marketing into our data warehouse. We're pulling data about all 3 hierarchy tiers and some daily metrics:

1. Campaigns (id, name, start time, stop time)
2. Ad Groups/Ad Sets (id, name)
3. Ads (id, name, URL)
4. Metrics (clicks, impressions, spend) for the previous day

For the Google Ads API, you basically send a SQL query and the return time is like a tenth of a second.

For Facebook, we see returns times in the minutes, especially on the Ads piece. Was hoping to get an idea of how others might have successfully set up a process to get this data from Facebook in a more timely fashion, and possibly without hitting the rate limiting threshold.

Not the exact code we're using - I can get it off my work system tomorrow - but the gist:

    from facebook_business.adobjects.adaccount import AdAccount
    from facebook_business.adobjects.campaign import Campaign
    from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import AdSet
    from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import Ad
    from facebook_business.adobjects.adcreative import AdCreative
    campaigns = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_campaigns(
        params={},
        fields=[Campaign.Field.id,Campaign.Field.name,Campaign.Field.start_time,Campaign.Field.stop_time]
    )
    adsets= AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_sets(
        params={},
        fields=[AdSet.Field.id,AdSet.Field.name]
    )
    ads = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ads(
        params={},
        fields=[Ad.Field.id,Ad.Field.name,Ad.Field.creative]
    )
    object_urls = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_creatives(
        params={},
        fields=[AdCreative.Field.object_story_spec]
    )
    asset_urls = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_creatives(
        params={},
        fields=[AdCreative.Field.asset_feed_spec]
    )

We then have to do some joining between ads/object\_urls/asset\_urls to match the Ad with the destination URL if the ad is clicked on.

The performance is so slow, that I hope we are doing it wrong. I was never able to get the batch call to work and I'm not sure how to improve things.

Feeling stuck. How to move ahead,"I have been working for a consulting firm for the past 5 years. The kind of work they assign me to is fairly basic - developing pipelines using Informatica and writing SQL queries for it. That's been majority of my experience. For the past # months, I've been assigned to a PowerBI developer role, but I just tweak the data/queries to do what the client asks. When I try to apply for data engineering/etl roles, I get asked what I think are pretty advanced questions - for example I got asked about what gaps I have noticed in Microsoft Fabric and what are best practices for data modeling etc. I tend to give general answera based on my research and theoretical answers, but I can never relate it to my actual experience because day to day I don't do anything high level. I get asked about how I optimzied queries or pipelines, the truth is I worked with small enough datasets that I never really had to do anything. Again, I give answers based on my research - like indexing or partitioning but I feel the people asking questions are always looking for more. 

I cannot leave or take a break, I'm on a visa, but how do I actually get further then. Is anyone else feeling the same?

Yet another iceberg catalog choice question,"We are an AWS and Databricks shop. We want to explore open source engines for cost savings and reduce vendor lock. 

We want to introduce iceberg. This interoperability with Flink, Snowflake, Trino.

What is a research and BI analyst?,"Hey, before this gets taken down \*I have read the wiki and it did not answer my question\*

I've just signed the contract for a Data Engineering role, but it lists me as a Research and BI Analyst without any mention of data engineering. I should note I'm gonna be an intern and I have zero corporate experience so job titles are new territory for me, sorry if it's really obvious and I'm being clueless.

Is this is a type of data engineer? Have they made a mistake on the contract? Does BI stand for Business Intelligence? What do I even do???

Roast my simple project. STAR schema database containing London weather data,"Hey all,

I've just created my second mini-project. Again, just to practice the skill I have learnt through DataCamp's courses.

  
I imported London's weather data via OpenWeather's API, cleaned it and created a database from it (STAR Schema)

  
If I had to do it again I will probably write functions instead of doing transformations manually. I really don't know why I didn't start of using function

  
I think my next project will include multiple different data sources and will also include some form of orchestration.

Here is the link: [https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/6aa0a025-9fe8-4291-bafd-67e1fc0d0005/edit](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/6aa0a025-9fe8-4291-bafd-67e1fc0d0005/edit)

Help a noob understand whether this is feasible,"Hey all,
I’m working on a project that involves building a comprehensive overview of all therapist-related businesses in my country. I’ve found a public online source that lists approximately 16,000 such businesses, spread across many paginated result pages.

Each entry links to a detail page with information such as:

Business name
Business owner (person or legal entity)
Registration number (similar to a company ID)
Location (optional)
No consistent link to a website, but it's often listed in the details

What I need help with:

(1) Scrape all business data into a structured list (CSV, JSON or database).
This involves crawling through all paginated pages and collecting each business profile’s content.

(2) Automatically search for a homepage/website for each business.
The source doesn't always list websites, so for those missing, I'd like to auto-search Google (or use a business API if necessary) to find the most likely company homepage.
(3) If a homepage is found: scrape relevant data from the website itself.

Goal:
To build a clean, filterable dataset that can be used for matching clients with therapists (via a separate platform I'm developing).

Questions I’d like help with:

Is this technically feasible using open tools or affordable APIs? What/who exactly would I be looking for? I have tried navigating Fiverr, but I am simply not sure what I need to be frank...

Feedback on Terraform Data Stack Starter,"Hi, everyone!

I'm a solo data consultant and over the past few years, I’ve been helping companies in Europe build their data stacks.

I noticed I was repeatedly performing the same tasks across my projects: setting up dbt, configuring Snowflake, and, more recently, migrating to Iceberg data lakes.

So I've been working on a solution for the past few months called [**Boring Data**](http://boringdata.io).

It's a set of Terraform templates ready to be deployed in AWS and/or Snowflake with pre-built integrations for ELT tools and orchestrators.

I think these templates are a great fit for many projects:

* Pay once, own it forever
* Get started fast
* Full control

I'd love to get feedback on this approach, which isn't very common (from what I've seen) in the data industry.

Is Terraform commonly used on your teams, or is that a barrier to using templates like these?

Help with a data engineering project,"Hello guys, me and teammates want to do a project from a-z to practice what we learned in an internship we are in and we wanted to the project to be about a telecom company’s data and we have searched a lot for a dataset that mimics the datasets of real telecom companies but we never found what we are looking for so we thought about creating the data we want using AI but for some reason it’s also not working out for us so i would love to hear some suggestions about what we should do and about telecom data warehouses and databases because i feel maybe we just don’t still quite understand how telecom companies generally operate and perhaps that’s why we are not successful in generating the data.

I hope this post makes sense because i’m just very confused and don’t know what to do for this project.

"How would you solve a low-tech, distributed attendance tracking and service impact problem for a nonprofit with no digital infrastructure?","I’m working with a nonprofit, supporting 17 veteran communities. The communities aren’t brick-and-mortar — they meet at churches and community spaces, and track attendance manually. There’s very little technology — no computers, mostly just phones and Facebook.

They want to understand:
	•	What services are being offered at the community level
	•	Who’s attending (recurring vs new)
	•	No-show rates
	•	Cost per veteran for services

The challenge: no digital systems or staff capacity for manual data entry.

Faster way to view + debug data,"Hi r/dataengineering!

  
I wanted to share a project that I have been working on. It's an intuitive data editor where you can interact with local and remote data (e.g. Athena & BigQuery). For several important tasks, it can speed you up by 10x or more. (see website for more)

  
For data engineering specifically, this would be really useful in debugging pipelines, cleaning local or remote data, and being able to easy create new tables within data warehouses etc.

I know this could be a lot faster than having to type everything out, especially if you're just poking around. I personally find myself using this before trying any manual work.

Also, for those doing complex queries, you can split them up and work with the frame visually and add queries when needed. Super useful for when you want to iteratively build an analysis or new frame ***without writing a super long query.***

  
As for data size, it can handle local data up to around 1B rows, and remote data is only limited by your data warehouse.

  
You don't have to migrate *anything* either.

  
If you're interested, you can check it out here: [https://www.cocoalemana.com](https://www.cocoalemana.com)

  
I'd love to hear about your workflow, and see what we can change to make it cover more data engineering use cases.

How to stream results of a complex SQL query,"Hello,

I'm writing you because I have a problem with a side project and maybe here somebody can help me. I have to run a complex query with a potentially high number of results and it takes a lot of time. However, for my project I don't need all the results to be showed together, perhaps after some hours/days. It would be much more useful to get a stream of the partial results in real time. How can I achieve this? I would prefer to use free software, however please suggest me any solution you have in mind.

How do I get out of this rut,"I’m currently about the finish an early career rotational program with a top 10 bank. The rotation I am currently on and where the company is placing me post program (I tried to get placed somewhere else) is as a data engineer on a data delivery team. When I was advertised this rotation and the team I was told pretty specifically we would be using all the relevant technologies and I would be very hands on keyboard building pipelines with python , configuring cloud services and snowflake, being a part of data modeling. Mind you I’m not completely new I have experience with all this in personal projects and previous work experience as a SWE and researcher in college. 

Turns out all of that was a lie. I later learned there is an army of contractors that do the actual work. I was stuck with analyzing .egp files and other SAS files documenting it and handing off to consultants to rebuild in Talend to ingest into snowflake. The only tech that I use is Visio and Word.

I coped with that by saying after I’m out of the program I’ll get to do the actual work. But I had a conversation with my manager today about what my role will be post program. He basically said there are a lot more of these SAS procedures they are porting over to talend and snowflake and I’ll be documenting them and handing over to contractors so they can implement the new process. Honestly that is all really quick and easy to do because there isn’t that much complicated business logic for the LOBs we support just joins and the occasional aggregation so most days I’m not doing anything.

When I told him I would really like to be involved in the technical work or the data modeling , he said that is not my job anymore and that is what we pay the contractors to do so I can’t do it. Almost made it seem like I should be grateful and he is doing me a favor somehow.

It just feels like I was misled or even outright lied to about the position. We don’t use any of the technologies that were advertised (Drag and drop/low code tools seem like fake engineering), I don’t get to be hands on keyboard at all. Just seems like there really I no growth or opportunity in this role. I would leave but I took relocation and a signing bonus for this and if I leave too early I owe it back. I also can’t internally transfer anywhere for a year after starting my new role.

I guess my rant is just to ask what should I be doing in this situation? I work on personal projects and open source and I have gotten a few certs in the downtime at work but I don’t know if it’s enough to make sure my skills don’t atrophy while I wait out my repayment period. I consider myself a somewhat technical guy but I have been boxed into a non technical role.

"Airbyte Connector Builder now supports GraphQL, Async Requests and Custom Components","Hello, Marcos from the Airbyte Team.

For those who may not be familiar, Airbyte is an open-source data integration (EL) platform with over 500 connectors for APIs, databases, and file storage.

In our last release we added several new features to our no-code Connector Builder:

* [GraphQL Support](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/request-options#graphql-request-injection): In addition to REST, you can now make requests to GraphQL APIs (and properly handle pagination!)
* [Async Data Requests](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/connector-builder-ui/async-streams): There are some reporting APIs that do not return responses immediately. For instance, with Google Ads.  You can now request a custom report from these sources and wait for the report to be processed and downloaded.
* [Custom Python Code Components](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/connector-builder-ui/custom-components): We recognize that some APIs behave uniquely—for example, by returning records as key-value pairs instead of arrays or by not ordering data correctly. To address these cases, our open-source platform now supports custom Python components that extend the capabilities of the no-code framework without blocking you from building your connector.

We believe these updates will make connector development faster and more accessible, helping you get the most out of your data integration projects.

We understand there are discussions about the trade-offs between no-code and low-code solutions. At Airbyte, transitioning from fully coded connectors to a low-code approach allowed us to maintain a large connector catalog using standard components.  We were also able to create a better build and test process directly in the UI. Users frequently give us the feedback that the no-code connector Builder enables less technical users to create and ship connectors. This reduces the workload on senior data engineers allowing them to focus on critical data pipelines.

Something else that has been top of mind is speed and performance. With a robust and stable connector framework, the engineering team has been dedicating significant resources to introduce concurrency to enhance sync speed. You can read this[ blog post](https://airbyte.com/blog/improving-connector-sync-speed-up-to-10x-faster) about how the team implemented concurrency in the Klaviyo connector, resulting in a speed increase of about 10x for syncs.

I hope you like the news!

Marketing Report & Fivetran,"Fishing for advice as I'm sure many have been here before. I came from DE at a SaaS company where I was more focused on the infra but now I'm in a role much close to the business and currently working with marketing. I'm sure this could make the Top-5 all time repeated DE tasks. A daily marketing report showing metrics like Spend, cost-per-click, engagement rate, cost-add-to-cart, cost-per-traffic... etc. These are per campaign based on various data sources like GA4, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, TikTok etc. Data updates once a day.

It should be obvious I'm not writing API connectors for a dozen different services. I'm just one person doing this and have many other things to do. I have Fivetran up and running getting the data I need but MY GOD is it ever expensive for something that seems like it should be simple, infrequent & low volume. It comes with a ton of build in reports that I don't even need sucking rows and bloating the bill. I can't seem to get what I need without pulling millions of event rows which costs a fortune to do.

Are there other similar but (way) cheaper solutions are out there?

PII Obfuscation in Databricks,"Hi Data Champs,

I have been recently given chance to explore PII obfuscation technique in databricks.

I proposed using sql aes_encryption or python fernet for PII column level encryption before landing to bronze.

And use column masking on delta tables which has built in logic for group membership check and decryption so to avoid the overhead of a new view per table.

My HDE was more interested in sql approach than the fernet but fernet offers built in key rotation out of the box.

Has anyone used aes_encryption 
Is it secure, easy to work with and relatively more robust.

From my experience for data type other than binary like long, int, double it needs to be first converted to binary (don’t like it)

Apart from that usual error here and there for padding and generic error when decrypting sometimes.

So given the choice what will be your architecture 

What you will prefer, what you don’t and why

Ingesting a billion small .csv files from blob?,"Currently, we're ""streaming"" data by having an Azure Function write event grid messages to csv in blob storage, and then by having snowpipe ingest them. There's about a million csv's generated daily. The blob is not partitioned at all.

What's the best way to ingest/delete everything? Snowpipe has a configuration error, and a portion of the data hasn't been loaded, ever. ADF was pretty slow when I tested it out.

This was all done by consultants before I was in house btw.


edit: I was a bit unclear in my message. I mean, that we've had snowpipe ingesting these files. However, now we need to re-ingest the billion or so small .csv's that are in the blob, to compare the data to the already ingested data.

What further complicates this is:

- we also need to parse the filename to a column

"reflect-cpp - a C++20 library for fast serialization, deserialization and validation using reflection, like Python's Pydantic or Rust's serde.","[https://github.com/getml/reflect-cpp](https://github.com/getml/reflect-cpp)

I am a data engineer, ML engineer and software developer with strong background in functional programming. As such, I am a strong proponent of the ""Parse, Don't Validate"" principle (https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/).  
  
Unfortunately, C++ does not yet support reflection, which is necessary to do something apply these principles. However, after some discussions on the topic over on r/cpp, we figured out a way to do this anyway. This library emerged out of these discussions.

Best way to handle loading JSON API data into database in pipelines,"Greetings, this is my first post here. I've been working in DE for the last 5 years now doing various things with Airflow and Dagster.  I have a question regarding design of data flow from APIs to our database.

I am using Dagster/Python to perform the API pulls and loads into Snowflake.

My team lead insists that we load JSON data into our Snowflake RAW\_DATA in the following way:

ID (should be a surrogate/non-native PK)  
PAYLOAD (raw JSON payload, either as a VARCHAR or VARIANT type)  
CREATED\_DATE (timestamp this row was created in Snowflake)  
UPDATE\_DATE (timestamp this row was updated in Snowflake)

Flattening of the payload then happens in SQL as a plain View, which we currently autogenerate using Python and manually edit and add to Snowflake.

He does not want us (DE team) to use DBT to do any transforming of RAW\_DATA. DBT is only for the Data Analyst team to use for creating models.

The main advantage I see to this approach is flexibility if the JSON schema changes. You can freely append/drop/insert/reorder/rename columns. whereas a normal table you can only drop, append, and rename.

On the downside, it is slow and clunky to parse with SQL and access the data as a view. It just seems inefficient to have to recompute the view and parse all those JSON payloads whenever you want to access the table.  
  
I'd much rather do the flattening in Python, either manually or using dlt. Some JSON payloads I 'pre-flatten' in Python to make them easier to parse in SQL.

Is there a better way, or is this how you all handle this as well?",6,1,2025-04-08 23:56:12,0,False,2025-04-09 00:01:00,False,False,2025-04-08 23:56:12,23,Tuesday,272.0,1563,70.02,15,390,10.9,0,0,NEGATIVE,-0.9981860518455505,"['greetings', 'first', 'post', 'ive', 'working', 'last', 'years', 'various', 'things', 'airflow', 'dagster', 'question', 'regarding', 'design', 'data', 'flow', 'apis', 'database', 'using', 'dagsterpython', 'perform', 'api', 'pulls', 'loads', 'snowflake', 'team', 'lead', 'insists', 'load', 'json', 'data', 'snowflake', 'rawdata', 'following', 'way', 'surrogatenonnative', 'payload', 'raw', 'json', 'payload', 'either', 'varchar', 'variant', 'type', 'createddate', 'timestamp', 'row', 'created', 'snowflake', 'updatedate', 'timestamp', 'row', 'updated', 'snowflake', 'flattening', 'payload', 'happens', 'sql', 'plain', 'view', 'currently', 'autogenerate', 'using', 'python', 'manually', 'edit', 'add', 'snowflake', 'want', 'team', 'use', 'dbt', 'transforming', 'rawdata', 'dbt', 'data', 'analyst', 'team', 'use', 'creating', 'models', 'main', 'advantage', 'see', 'approach', 'flexibility', 'json', 'schema', 'changes', 'freely', 'appenddropinsertreorderrename', 'columns', 'whereas', 'normal', 'table', 'drop', 'append', 'rename', 'downside', 'slow', 'clunky', 'parse', 'sql', 'access', 'data', 'view', 'seems', 'inefficient', 'recompute', 'view', 'parse', 'json', 'payloads', 'whenever', 'want', 'access', 'table', 'much', 'rather', 'flattening', 'python', 'either', 'manually', 'using', 'dlt', 'json', 'payloads', 'preflatten', 'python', 'make', 'easier', 'parse', 'sql', 'better', 'way', 'handle', 'well']",greetings first post ive working last years various things airflow dagster question regarding design data flow apis database using dagsterpython perform api pulls loads snowflake team lead insists load json data snowflake rawdata following way surrogatenonnative payload raw json payload either varchar variant type createddate timestamp row created snowflake updatedate timestamp row updated snowflake flattening payload happens sql plain view currently autogenerate using python manually edit add snowflake want team use dbt transforming rawdata dbt data analyst team use creating models main advantage see approach flexibility json schema changes freely appenddropinsertreorderrename columns whereas normal table drop append rename downside slow clunky parse sql access data view seems inefficient recompute view parse json payloads whenever want access table much rather flattening python either manually using dlt json payloads preflatten python make easier parse sql better way handle well,High,1,1,"data, like, use, would, get, want, new, also, way, make, etc, something, better, one, help, snowflake, databricks, lot, best, find, team, build, think, used, seems, might, process, able, done, solution, code, approach, right, google, start, since, instead, many, another, big, everything, thats, multiple, questions, however, similar, redshift, part, wondering, two, model, youre, based, tried, problem, understand, open, easy, whats, teams, maybe, real, sources, idea, tests, full, issues, stuff, try, useful, within, product, functions, next, implement, various, thinking, high, creating, version, hope, basically, input, step, options, context, fit, production, super, moving, drop, reports, pay, worth, community, related, search, sense, lake, documentation, quality, struggling, following, comes, modeling, makes, helps, results, clean, test, several, gets, limited, important, structures, early, thought, prefer, pricing, necessary, base, apply, delta, whole, side, ways, considering, task, along, whether, certain, put, group, learned, place, fivetran, plan, plus, internal, definitely, asked, pain, git, migrate, guidance, keeping, saas, entire, involves, lineage, client, looks, couple, considered, value, heres, regarding, writing, ingesting, control, arent, top, ideally, syntax, expensive, downstream, ideas, evolve, facing, rather, total, online, initial, windows, adf, mean, painful, personally, behind, expect, sample, tested, required, explore, huge, warehouses, somewhere, website, purpose, hit, topic, present, risk, implementing, relevant, wasnt, consider, infrastructure, replace, low, cons, practical, mechanism, party, bad, observability, identify, scraping, marketing, fix, vendor, replication, entry, approaches, sort, inputs, wed, logging, zero, somehow, email, written, designed, normally, pass, ease, perhaps, medallion, benchmark, nothing, engagement, non, choice, mess, recovery, steps, customer, failed, standard, amount, tsql, servers, needing, optimizing, extra, lists, lately, obvious, visual, matching, showing, clients, play, powerbi, problems, businesses, legacy, implementation, relying, automation, magic, decided, stat, eventually, automating, scala",7.7,7.0,150.9,-0.663,921.0,50.8,8.5,225.4,9.7,21.4,16.7,83,183,70,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

Help: Looking to set up a decent data architecture (data lake and/or warehouse),"Hi, I need help. I need a proper architecture for a department, and I am trying to get a data lake/warehouse.

Why: We have a lot of data sources from SaaS to manually created documents. We use a lot of SaaS products, but we have no centralised repository to store and stage the data, so we end up with a lot of workaround such as using SharePoint and csv stored in folders for reporting. We also change SaaS products quite frequently, so sources can change often. It is difficult to do advanced analytics. 

I prefer a lake & warehouse approach because (1) for SaaS users, they can can just drop the data to the lake and (2) transformation and processing can be done for reporting, and we could combine the datasets even when we change the SaaS software. 

My huge considerations are that (1) the data is to be accessible within the department only and (2) it has to be decent cost. Currently considered Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 & DataBricks, or Snowflake (to have both the lake and warehouse). My previous experience was only with Data Lake Storage Gen2.

I'm willing to work my way up for my technical limitations, but at this stage I am exploring the software solutions to get the buy in to kickstart this project.

Beginner Predictive Model Feedback/Guidance,"My predictive modeling folks, beginner here could use some feedback guidance. Go easy on me, this is my first machine learning/predictive model project and I had very basic python experience before this.


I’ve been working on a personal project building a model that predicts NFL player performance using full career, game-by-game data for any offensive player who logged a snap between 2017–2024. 

I trained the model using data through 2023 with XGBoost Regressor, and then used actual 2024 matchups — including player demographics (age, team, position, depth chart) and opponent defensive stats (Pass YPG, Rush YPG, Points Allowed, etc.) — as inputs to predict game-level performance in 2024.

The model performs really well for some stats (e.g., R² > 0.875 for Completions, Pass Attempts, CMP%, Pass Yards, and Passer Rating), but others — like Touchdowns, Fumbles, or Yards per Target — aren’t as strong.

Here’s where I need input:

-What’s a solid baseline R², RMSE, and MAE to aim for — and does that benchmark shift depending on the industry?

-Could trying other models/a combination of models improve the weaker stats? Should I use different models for different stat categories (e.g., XGBoost for high-R² ones, something else for low-R²)?

-How do you typically decide which model is the best fit? Trial and error? Is there a structured way to choose based on the stat being predicted?

-I used XGBRegressor based on common recommendations — are there variants of XGBoost or alternatives you'd suggest trying? Any others you like better?

-Are these considered “good” model results for sports data?

-Are sports models generally harder to predict than industries like retail, finance, or real estate?

-What should my next step be if I want to make this model more complete and reliable (more accurate) across all stat types?

-How do people generally feel about manually adding in more intangible stats to tweak data and model performance? Example: Adding an injury index/strength multiplier for a Defense that has a lot of injuries, or more player’s coming back from injury, etc.? Is this a generally accepted method or not really utilized?

How do you group your tables into pipelines?,"I was wondering how do data engineers in different company group their pipelines together ?

Usually tables need to be refreshed at some specific refresh rates. This means that some table upstream might require 1h refresh while downstream table might require daily.

I can see people grouping things by domain and running domain one after each other sequentially, but then this break the concept of having different refresh rate per table or domain. I can see table configure with multiple corn but then I see issues with needing to schedule offset in cron jobs. 

Like most of the domain are very close to each other so when creating them I might be mixing a lot of stuff together which would impact downstream.

What’s your experience in structuring pipeline? Or any good reference I can read ?

What is the best way to reflect data in clickhouse from MySQL other than the MySQL engine?,"Hi everyone, I am working on a project currently where we have a MySQL database. We are using clickhouse as our warehouse. 

What we need to achieve is to reflect the data from MySQL to clickhouse for certain tables. For this, I found a few ways and am looking to get some insights on which method has the most potential and if there are other methods as welp:

1. Use the MySQL engine in clickhouse. 

Pros: No need to store data in clickhouse as it can just proxy it directly from MySQL.

Cons: This however puts extra reads on MySQL and doesn't help us if MySQL ever goes down. 

2. Use signals to send the data to clickhouse whenever there is a change in MySQL.

Pros: We don't have a lot of tables currently so it's the quickest to setup. 

Cons: Extremely inefficient and not scalable. 

3. Use some sort of third party sink to achieve this. I have found this https://github.com/Altinity/clickhouse-sink-connector which seems to do the job but it has way too many open issues and not sure if it is reliable enough. Plus, it complicates our tech stack which we are looking not to do. 

I'm open to any other ideas. We would ideally not want to duplicate this data in clickhouse but if that's the last resort we would go for it. 

Thanks in advance.

Beginning Data Scientist in Azure needing some help (iot),"Hi all,

I currently am working on a new structure to save sensor data coming from Azure Iot Hub in Azure to store it into Azure Blob Storage for historical data, and Clickhouse for hot data with TTL (around half year). The sensor data is coming from different entities (e.g building1, boat1, boat2) and should be partioned by entity. The data we’re processing daily is around 300-2 million records per day.

I know Azure Iot Hub is essentially a built-in Azure Hub. I had a few questions since I’ve tried multiple solutions. 

1. Normal message routing to Azure Blob
Issue: no custom partitioning on file structure (e.g entityid/timestamp_sensor/) it requires you to use the enqueued time. And there is no dead letter queue for fallback

2. IoT hub -> Azure Functions -> Blob Storage & Clickhouse
Issue: this should work correctly but I have not that much experience in Azure Functions, I tried creating a function with the IoT Hub template but it seems I need to also have an Event Hubs namespace which is not what I want. HTTP trigger is also not what I want. I don’t find any good documentation on it aswell. I know I can maybe use Event Hubs trigger and use the Iot Hub connection string but I didn’t manage to do this yet.

3. IoT hub -> Event Grid 
Someone suggested using Event Grid, however to my knowledge Event Grid is not used for telemetry data despite there being an option for. Is this beneficial? I don’t really know what the flow would be since you can’t use Event Grid to send data to Clickhouse. You would still need an Azure Functions.

4. IoT Hub -> Event Grid -> Event Hubs -> Azure Functions -> Azure Blob & Clickhouse
This one seemed the most appealing to me but I don’t know if it’s the smartest, it can get expensive (maybe).
But the idea here is that we use Event Grid for batching the data and to have a dead letter queue.
Arrived in Event Hubs we use an Azure Function to send the data to blob storage and clickhouse.

The only problem is I might need some delay to sending to Clickhouse & Blob Storage (around maybe every 15 minutes) to reduce the risks of memory usage in Clickhouse and to reduce costs.

Can someone help me out? Am I forgetting something crucial? I am a graduated data scientist, however I have no in depth experience with Azure.

Experienced data engineer looking to expand to devops,"Hey everyone, I've been a working a few years as a data engineer, I'd say I'm very comfortable in python (databricks), sql and git and have mostly worked in Azure. I would like to get comfortable with devops, setting up proper ci/cd, iac etc.

What resources would you recommend?

Where I work we 2 repos set up, an infratsructure repo that I am totally clueless about that is mostly terraform and another repo where we make changes to notebooks and pipelines etc whose structure makes more sense to me.

The whole thing was initially set up by consultants. My goal is really to understand how it was set up, why 2 different repos, how to change the ci/cd pipeline to add testing etc.

How do my fellow on-prem DEs keep their sanity...,"...the joys of memory and compute resources seems to be a neverending suck 😭

We're building ETL pipelines, using Airflow in one K8s namespace and Spark in another (the latter having dedicated hardware). Most data workloads aren't really Spark-worthy as files are typically <20GB, and we keep hitting pain points where processes struggle in Airflow's memory (workers are 6Gi and 6 CPU, with a limit of 10GI; no KEDA or HPA). We are looking into more efficient data structures like DuckDB, Polars, etc or running ""mid-tier"" processes as separate K8s jobs but then we hit constraints like tools/libraries relying on Pandas use so we seem stuck with eager processes.

Case in point, I just learned that our teams are having to split files into smaller files of 125k records so Pydantic schema validation won't fail on memory. I looked into GX Core and see the main source options there again appear to be Pandas or Spark dataframes (yes, I'm going to try DuckDB through SQLAlchemy). I could bite the bullet and just say to go with Spark, but then our pipelines will be using Spark for QA and not for ETL which will be fun to keep clarifying.

Which API system for my Postgres DWH?,"Hi everyone,

I am building a data warehouse for my company and because we have to process mostly spatial data I went with a postgres materialization. My stack is currently:

- dlt
- dbt
- dagster
- postgres

Now I have the use case that our developers at our company need some of the data for our software solutions to be integrated. And I would like to provide an API for easy access to the data. 

So I am wondering which solution is best for me. I have some experience in a private project with postgREST and found it pretty cool to directly use DB views and functions as endpoints for the API. But tools like FastAPI might be more mature for a production system. What would you recommend?

I'm struggling to evaluate job offer and would appreciate outside opinions,"I've been searching for a new opportunity over the last few years (500+ applications) and have finally received an offer I'm strongly considering. I would really like to hear some outside opinions.

## Current position
- Analytics Lead

- Tool stack: on-prem SQL Server, SSIS, Power BI, some Python/R
- Downsides: 
	- Incoherent/non-existent corporate data strategy
	- 3 days required in-office (~20-minute commute)
	- Lack of executive support for data and analytics
	- Data Scientist and Data Engineer roles have recently been eliminated
	- No clear path for additional growth or progression 
	- A significant part of the job involves training/mentoring several inexperienced analysts, which I don't enjoy
- Upsides: 
	- Very stable company (no risk of layoffs)
	- Very good relationship with direct manager

## New offer
- Senior Data Analyst
- $130k base, 10% bonus
- Tool stack: BigQuery, FiveTran, dbt / SQLMesh, Looker Studio, GSheets
- Downsides:
	- High-growth company, potentially volatile industry
- Upsides:
	- Fully remote
	- Working alongside experienced data engineers

Other info/significant factors:
- My current company paid for my MSDS degree, and they are within their right to claw back the entire ~$37k tuition if I leave.  I'm prepared to pay this, but it's a big factor in the decision.
- At this stage in my career, I'm putting a very high value on growth/development opportunities

We're currently running into scaling issues with our in-house data catalog and I think we need something more robust for governance and lineage tracking.

I've narrowed it down to Acryl (DataHub) and Collate (openmetadata) as the main contenders. I know I should look at Collibra and Alation and maybe Unity Catalog?

For context, we're a mid-sized fintech (\~500 employees) with about 30 data engineers and scientists. We're AWS with Snowflake, Airflow for orchestration, and a growing number of ML models in production.

My question list is: 

1. How these tools handle machine-scale operations 
2. How painful was it to get set up?
3. For DataHub and openmetadata specifically - is the open source version viable or is the cloud version necessary?
4. Any unexpected limitations you've hit with any of these platforms?
5. Do you feel like these grow with you as we increasingly head into AI governance? 
6. How well they integrate with existing tools (Snowflake, dbt, Looker, etc.)

If anyone has switched from one solution to another, I'd love to hear why you made the change and whether it was worth it.

Sorry for the pick list of questions - the last post on this was years ago and I was hoping for some more insights. Thanks in advance for anyone's thoughts.

Is this take-home assignment too large and complex ?,"I was given the following assignment as part of a job application. Would love to hear if people think this is reasonable or overkill for a take-home test:

**Assignment Summary:**

* Build a **Python data pipeline** and expose it via an **API**.
* The API must:
   * Accept a **venue ID**, **start date**, and **end date**.
   * Use Open-Meteo's historical weather API to fetch **hourly weather data** for the specified range and location.
   * Extract 10+ parameters (e.g., temperature, precipitation, snowfall, etc.).
   * Store the data in a **cloud-hosted database**.
   * Return success or error responses accordingly.
* Design the database schema for storing the weather data.
* Use **OpenAPI 3.0** to document the API.
* Deploy on **any cloud provider** (AWS, Azure, or GCP), including:
   * Database
   * API runtime
   * API Gateway or equivalent
* Set up **CI/CD pipeline** for the solution.
* Include a **README** with setup and testing instructions (Postman or Curl).
* Implement **QA checks in SQL** for data consistency.

How do my fellow on-prem DEs keep their sanity...,"...the joys of memory and compute resources seems to be a neverending suck 😭

We're building ETL pipelines, using Airflow in one K8s namespace and Spark in another (the latter having dedicated hardware). Most data workloads aren't really Spark-worthy as files are typically <20GB, and we keep hitting pain points where processes struggle in Airflow's memory (workers are 6Gi and 6 CPU, with a limit of 10GI; no KEDA or HPA). We are looking into more efficient data structures like DuckDB, Polars, etc or running ""mid-tier"" processes as separate K8s jobs but then we hit constraints like tools/libraries relying on Pandas use so we seem stuck with eager processes.

Case in point, I just learned that our teams are having to split files into smaller files of 125k records so Pydantic schema validation won't fail on memory. I looked into GX Core and see the main source options there again appear to be Pandas or Spark dataframes (yes, I'm going to try DuckDB through SQLAlchemy). I could bite the bullet and just say to go with Spark, but then our pipelines will be using Spark for QA and not for ETL which will be fun to keep clarifying.

Self-Healing Data Quality in DBT — Without Any Extra Tools,"I just published a practical breakdown of a method I call **Observe & Fix** — a simple way to manage data quality in DBT without breaking your pipelines or relying on external tools.

It’s a self-healing pattern that works entirely within DBT using native tests, macros, and logic — and it’s ideal for fixable issues like duplicates or nulls.

We built a natural language search tool for finding U.S. government datasets,"Hey everyone! My friend and I built [Crystal](https://askcrystal.info/search), a tool to help you search through 300,000+ datasets from [data.gov](http://data.gov) using plain English.

Example queries:

* *""Air quality in NYC after 2015""*
* *""Unemployment trends in Texas""*
* *""Obesity rates in Alabama""*

It finds and ranks the most relevant datasets, with clean summaries and download links.

We made it because searching [data.gov](http://data.gov) can be frustrating — we wanted something that feels more like asking a smart assistant than guessing keywords.

"Landed a Role with SQL/dbt, But Clueless About Data Modeling — Advice?","Hi everyone,  
I’m a 2025 new grad starting this May, and I’ll be working at a small start-up as an Analytics Engineer. I’ve gotten pretty solid at SQL as I’ve been grinding Leetcode questions for fun, and it really helped me land the job. During my internships, I also worked a lot with dbt, Snowflake, and Airflow, so I’m fairly comfortable with the tooling side of things. 

Where I’m struggling is data modeling—specifically the Kimball methodology, Star Schemas, and different types of dimensions and fact tables. I tried reading the Kimball book, but honestly, it felt super abstract without any hands-on practice. I get that real data modeling often involves trade-offs, business context, and actual stakeholder input, which isn’t easy to simulate on your own.

So my question is—how can a college student or new grad start building intuition and skills in data modeling? Are there any practical resources or projects I can work through to better understand this area? And if you have any general advice for someone entering the industry in this kind of role, I’d love to hear it.

Data modeling for analytics with legacy Schema-on-Read data lake?,"Most guides on data modeling and data pipelines seem to focus on greenfield projects.

But how do you deal with a legacy data lake where there's been years of data written into tables with no changes to original source-defined schemas?

I have hundreds of table schemas which analysts want to use but can't because they have to manually go through the data catalogue and find every column containing 'x' data or simply not bothering with some tables.

How do you tackle such a legacy mess of data? Say I want to create a Kimball model that models a persons fact table as the grain, and dimensions tables for biographical and employment data. Is my only choice to just manually inspect all the different tables to find which have the kind of column I need? Note here that there wasn't even a basic normalisation of column names enforced (""phone_num"", ""phone"", ""tel"", ""phone_number"" etc) and some of this data is already in OBT form with some containing up to a hundred sparsely populated columns.

Do I apply fuzzy matching to identify source columns? Use an LLM to build massive mapping dictionaries? What are some approaches or methods I should consider when tackling this so I'm not stuck scrolling through infinite print outs? There is a metadata catalogue with some columns having been given tags to identify its content, but these aren't consistent and also have high cardinality.

From the business perspective, they want completeness, so I can't strategically pick which tables to use and ignore the rest. Is there a way I should prioritize based on integrating the largest datasets first?

The tables are a mix of both static imports and a few daily pipelines.

Freelancing - Real Talk,"
Hey folks,
I’m a data/software engineer trying to break into freelancing, and honestly, I could use some advice. I’ve been focusing on niches like building ETL pipelines, automation tools, web scraping, data mining, and even playing around with RAG bots.

I’ve been on Upwork for about 2 months now and only landed one small scraping gig so far. My portfolio is pretty solid (or at least I think it is), but I’m not getting much traction, barely any invites.

So I’m wondering:

Is Upwork just super saturated for this kind of work right now?

Are there better platforms or communities for technical freelancing gigs (especially data-related)?

What worked for you when you were just starting out?

Is there a niche I should lean harder into?


Would love to hear from anyone who’s been through this or has some pointers. I'm open to harsh truths, hacks, or anything in between. Appreciate it!

Want opinion about Lambdas,"Hi all.
I'd love your opinion and experience about the data pipeline I'm working on.

The pipeline is for the RAG inference system.
The user would interact with the system through an API which triggers a Lambda.

The inference consists of  4 main functions-
1. Apply query guardrails
2. Fetch relevant chunks
3. Pass query and chunks to LLM and get response 
4. Apply source attribution (additional metadata related to the data) to the response 

I've assigned 1 AWS Lambda function to each component/function totalling to 4 lambdas in the pipeline.

Can the above mentioned functions be achieved under 30 secs if they're clubbed into 1 Lambda function?

Pls clarify in comments if this information is not sufficient to answer the question.

Also, please share any documentation that suggests which approach is better ( multiple lambdas or 1 lambda)

"Developing, testing and deploying production grade data pipelines with AWS Glue","Serious question for data engineers working with AWS Glue: How do you actually structure and test production-grade pipelines.

For simple pipelines it's straight forward: just write everything in a single job using glue's editor, run and you're good to go, but for production data pipelines, how is the gap between the local code base that is modularized ( utils, libs, etc ) bridged with glue, that apparently needs everything to be bundled into jobs?

This is the first thing I am struggling to understand, my second dilemma is about testing jobs locally.  
How does local testing happen?

**->** if we will use glue's compute engine we run into the first question of: gap between code base and single jobs.

**->** if we use open source spark locally:

1. data can be too big to be processed locally, even if we are just testing, and this might be the reason we opted for serverless spark on the first place.

  
2. Glue’s customized Spark runtime behaves differently than open-source Spark, so local tests won’t fully match production behavior.

Thoughts on Acryl vs other metadata platforms,"Hi all, I'm evaluating metadata management solutions for our data platform and would appreciate any thoughts from folks who've actually implemented these tools in production.

We're currently running into scaling issues with our in-house data catalog and I think we need something more robust for governance and lineage tracking.

I've narrowed it down to Acryl (DataHub) and Collate (openmetadata) as the main contenders. I know I should look at Collibra and Alation and maybe Unity Catalog?

For context, we're a mid-sized fintech (\~500 employees) with about 30 data engineers and scientists. We're AWS with Snowflake, Airflow for orchestration, and a growing number of ML models in production.

My question list is: 

1. How these tools handle machine-scale operations 
2. How painful was it to get set up?
3. For DataHub and openmetadata specifically - is the open source version viable or is the cloud version necessary?
4. Any unexpected limitations you've hit with any of these platforms?
5. Do you feel like these grow with you as we increasingly head into AI governance? 
6. How well they integrate with existing tools (Snowflake, dbt, Looker, etc.)

If anyone has switched from one solution to another, I'd love to hear why you made the change and whether it was worth it.

Sorry for the pick list of questions - the last post on this was years ago and I was hoping for some more insights. Thanks in advance for anyone's thoughts.

What to do and how to do???,"This is a photo of my notes (not OG rewrote later) about a meet at work about this said project. The project is about migration of ms sql server to snowflake. 

The code conversion will be done using Snowconvert. 

For historic data
1. The data extraction is done using a python script using bcp command and pyodbc library 
2. The converted code from snowconvert will be used in a python script again to create all the database objects. 
3. data extracted will be loaded into internal stage and then to table 

2 and 3 will use snowflake’s python connector 

For transitional data: 
1. Use ADF to store pipeline output into an Azure blob container 
2. Use external stage to utilise this blob and load data into table 


1. My question is if you have ADF for transitional data then why not use the same thing for historic data as well (I was given the task of historic data)
2. Is there a free way to handle this transitional data as well. It needs to be enterprise level (Also what is wrong with using VS Code extension) 
3. After I showed initial approach following things were asked by mentor/friend to incorporate in this to really sell my approach (He went home after giving me no clarification about how to do this and what even are they)
- validation of data on both sides 
- partition aware extraction

Why Data Warehouses Were Created?,"The original data chaos actually started *before* spreadsheets were common. In the pre-ERP days, most business systems were siloed—HR, finance, sales, you name it—all running on their own. To report on anything meaningful, you had to extract data from each system, often manually. These extracts were pulled at different times, using different rules, and then stitched togethe. The result? Data quality issues. And to make matters worse, people were running these reports directly against transactional databases—systems that were supposed to be optimized for speed and reliability, not analytics. The reporting load bogged them down.

The problem was so painful for the businesses, so around the late 1980s, a few forward-thinking folks—most famously Bill Inmon—proposed a better way: a data warehouse.

To make matter even worse, in the late ’00s every department had its own spreadsheet empire. Finance had one version of “the truth,” Sales had another, and Marketing were inventing their own metrics. People would walk into meetings with totally different numbers for the same KPI.

The spreadsheet party had turned into a data chaos rave. There was no lineage, no source of truth—just lots of tab-switching and passive-aggressive email threads. It wasn’t just annoying—it was a risk. Businesses were making big calls on bad data. So data warehousing became common practice!

Event Sourcing as a creative tool for developers,"Hey, I think there are better use cases for event sourcing.  
  
Event sourcing is an architecture where you capture every change in your system as an immutable event, rather than just storing the latest state. Instead of only knowing what your data looks like now, you keep a full history of how it got there. In a simple crud app that would mean that every deleted, updated, and created entry is stored in your event source, that way when you replay your events you can recreate the state that the application was in at any given time.

Most developers see event sourcing as a kind of technical safety net: - Recovering from failures - Rebuilding corrupted read models - Auditability

Surviving schema changes without too much pain

And fair enough, replaying your event stream often feels like a stressful situation. Something broke, you need to fix it, and you’re crossing your fingers hoping everything rebuilds cleanly.

What if replaying your event history wasn’t just for emergencies? What if it was a normal, everyday part of building your system?

Instead of treating replay as a recovery mechanism, you treat it as a development tool — something you use to evolve your data models, improve your logic, and shape new views of your data over time. More excitingly, it means you can derive entirely new schemas from your event history whenever your needs change.

Your database stops being the single source of truth and instead becomes what it was always meant to be: a fast, convenient cache for your data, not the place where all your logic and assumptions are locked in.

With a full event history, you’re free to experiment with new read models, adapt your data structures without fear, and shape your data exactly to fit new purposes — like enriching fields, backfilling values, or building dedicated models for AI consumption. Replay becomes not about fixing what broke, but about continuously improving what you’ve built.

And this has big implications — especially when it comes to AI and MCP Servers.

Most application databases aren’t built for natural language querying or AI-powered insights. Their schemas are designed for transactions, not for understanding. Data is spread across normalized tables, with relationships and assumptions baked deeply into the structure.

But when you treat your event history as the source of truth, you can replay your events into purpose-built read models, specifically structured for AI consumption.

Need flat, denormalized tables for efficient semantic search? Done. Want to create a user-centric view with pre-joined context for better prompts? Easy. You’re no longer limited by your application’s schema — you shape your data to fit exactly how your AI needs to consume it.

And here’s where it gets really interesting: AI itself can help you explore your data history and discover what’s valuable.

Instead of guessing which fields to include, you can use AI to interrogate your raw events, spot gaps, surface patterns, and guide you in designing smarter read models. It’s a feedback loop: your AI doesn’t just query your data — it helps you shape it.

So instead of forcing your AI to wrestle with your transactional tables, you give it clean, dedicated models optimized for discovery, reasoning, and insight.

And the best part? You can keep iterating. As your AI use cases evolve, you simply adjust your flows and replay your events to reshape your models — no migrations, no backfills, no re-engineering.",14,11,2025-04-14

Need Advice on solution - Mapping Inconsistent Country Names to Standardized Values,"Hi Folks,

In my current project, we are ingesting a wide variety of external public datasets. One common issue we’re facing is that the **country names in these datasets are not standardized**. For example, we may encounter entries like **""Burma"" instead of ""Myanmar""**, or **""Islamic Republic of Iran"" instead of ""Iran""**.

My initial approach was to extract all unique country name variations and map them to a list of standard country names using logic such as CASE WHEN conditions or basic string-matching techniques.

However, my manager has suggested we leverage **AI/LLM-based models** to automate the mapping of these country names to a standardized list to handle new query points as well. 

I have a couple of concerns and would appreciate your thoughts:

1. **Is using AI/LLMs a suitable approach for this problem?**
2. **Can LLMs be fully reliable in these mappings, or is there a risk of incorrect matches?**
3. I was considering implementing a **feedback pipeline** that highlights any newly encountered or unmapped country names during data ingestion so we can review and incorporate logic to handle them in the code over time. Would this be a better or complementary solution?
4. Please suggest if there is some better approach.

Looking forward to your insights!",8,9,2025-04-14 08:02:29,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-14 08:02:29,8,Monday,206.0,1280,62.48,12,316,11.4,0,0,NEGATIVE,-0.9988371729850769,"['folks', 'current', 'project', 'ingesting', 'wide', 'variety', 'external', 'public', 'datasets', 'one', 'common', 'issue', 'facing', 'country', 'names', 'datasets', 'standardized', 'example', 'may', 'encounter', 'entries', 'like', 'burma', 'instead', 'myanmar', 'islamic', 'republic', 'iran', 'instead', 'iran', 'initial', 'approach', 'extract', 'unique', 'country', 'name', 'variations', 'map', 'list', 'standard', 'country', 'names', 'using', 'logic', 'case', 'conditions', 'basic', 'stringmatching', 'techniques', 'however', 'manager', 'suggested', 'leverage', 'aillmbased', 'models', 'automate', 'mapping', 'country', 'names', 'standardized', 'list', 'handle', 'new', 'query', 'points', 'well', 'couple', 'concerns', 'would', 'appreciate', 'thoughts', 'using', 'aillms', 'suitable', 'approach', 'problem', 'llms', 'fully', 'reliable', 'mappings', 'risk', 'incorrect', 'matches', 'considering', 'implementing', 'feedback', 'pipeline', 'highlights', 'newly', 'encountered', 'unmapped', 'country', 'names', 'data', 'ingestion', 'review', 'incorporate', 'logic', 'handle', 'code', 'time', 'would', 'better', 'complementary', 'solution', 'please', 'suggest', 'better', 'approach', 'looking', 'forward', 'insights']",folks current project ingesting wide variety external public datasets one common issue facing country names datasets standardized example may encounter entries like burma instead myanmar islamic republic iran instead iran initial approach extract unique country name variations map list standard country names using logic case conditions basic stringmatching techniques however manager suggested leverage aillmbased models automate mapping country names standardized list handle new query points well couple concerns would appreciate thoughts using aillms suitable approach problem llms fully reliable mappings risk incorrect matches considering implementing feedback pipeline highlights newly encountered unmapped country names data ingestion review incorporate logic handle code time would better complementary solution please suggest better approach looking forward insights,High,1,1,"data, like, use, would, get, want, new, also, way, make, etc, something, better, one, help, snowflake, databricks, lot, best, find, team, build, think, used, seems, might, process, able, done, solution, code, approach, right, google, start, since, instead, many, another, big, everything, thats, multiple, questions, however, similar, redshift, part, wondering, two, model, youre, based, tried, problem, understand, open, easy, whats, teams, maybe, real, sources, idea, tests, full, issues, stuff, try, useful, within, product, functions, next, implement, various, thinking, high, creating, version, hope, basically, input, step, options, context, fit, production, super, moving, drop, reports, pay, worth, community, related, search, sense, lake, documentation, quality, struggling, following, comes, modeling, makes, helps, results, clean, test, several, gets, limited, important, structures, early, thought, prefer, pricing, necessary, base, apply, delta, whole, side, ways, considering, task, along, whether, certain, put, group, learned, place, fivetran, plan, plus, internal, definitely, asked, pain, git, migrate, guidance, keeping, saas, entire, involves, lineage, client, looks, couple, considered, value, heres, regarding, writing, ingesting, control, arent, top, ideally, syntax, expensive, downstream, ideas, evolve, facing, rather, total, online, initial, windows, adf, mean, painful, personally, behind, expect, sample, tested, required, explore, huge, warehouses, somewhere, website, purpose, hit, topic, present, risk, implementing, relevant, wasnt, consider, infrastructure, replace, low, cons, practical, mechanism, party, bad, observability, identify, scraping, marketing, fix, vendor, replication, entry, approaches, sort, inputs, wed, logging, zero, somehow, email, written, designed, normally, pass, ease, perhaps, medallion, benchmark, nothing, engagement, non, choice, mess, recovery, steps, customer, failed, standard, amount, tsql, servers, needing, optimizing, extra, lists, lately, obvious, visual, matching, showing, clients, play, powerbi, problems, businesses, legacy, implementation, relying, automation, magic, decided, stat, eventually, automating, scala",7.7,7.0,150.9,-0.663,921.0,50.8,8.5,225.4,9.7,21.4,16.7,83,183,70,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

Has anyone used Cube.js for operational (non-BI) use cases?,"The semantic layer in Cube looks super useful — defining metrics, dimensions, and joins in one place is a dream. But most use cases I’ve seen are focused on BI dashboards and analytics.

I’m wondering if anyone here has used Cube for more *operational* or *app-level* read scenarios — like powering parts of an internal tool, or building a unified read API across microservices (via Cube's GraphQL support). All read-only, but not just charts — more like structured data fetching.

Any war stories, performance considerations, or architectural tips? Curious if it holds up well when the use case isn't classic OLAP.

Advice on data warehouse design for ERP Integration with Power BI,"Hi everyone!

I’d like to ask for your advice on designing a relational data warehouse fed from our ERP system. We plan to use Power BI as our reporting tool, and all departments in the company will rely on it for analytics.

The challenge is that teams from different departments expect **the data to be fully related and ready** to use when building dashboards, minimizing the need for additional modeling. We’re struggling to determine the best approach to meet these expectations.

What would you recommend?

Should all dimensions and facts be pre-related in the data warehouse, even if it adds complexity?

Creating separate data models in Power BI for different departments/use cases?

Handling all relationships in the data warehouse and exposing them via curated datasets?

Should we empower Power BI users to create their own data models, or enforce strict governance with documented relationships?

Databricks Pain Points?,"Hi everyone,

My team is working on some tooling to build some user friendly ways to do things in Databricks. Our initial focus is around entity resolution, creating a simple tool that can evaluate the data in unity catalog and deduplicate tables, create identity graphs, etc.

I'm trying to get some insights from people who use Databricks day-to-day to figure out what other kinds of capabilities we'd want this thing to have if we want users to try it out. 

Some examples I have gotten from other venues so far:

* Cost optimization
* Annotating or using advanced features of Unity Catalog can't be done from the UI and users would like being able to do it without having to write a bunch of SQL
* Figuring out which libraries to use in notebooks for a specific use case

This is just an open call for input here. If you use Databricks all the time, what kind of stuff annoys you about it or is confusing?

For the record, this tool are building will be open source and this isn't an ad. The eventual tool will be free to use, I am just looking for broader input into how to make it as useful as possible.

How do managed services work with vendors like ClickHouse?,"  
**Context:**  
New to data engineering. New to the cloud too. I am in charge of doing trade studies on various storage solutions for my new company. I'm gathering requirements for the system, then pricing out options that meet those requirements. At the end of all my research, I have to present my trade studies so leadership can decide how to spend their cash.  

**Question:**  
I am seeing a lot of companies that do ""managed services"" that are not native to a cloud provider like AWS. For example, I see that ClickHouse offers managed services that piggy back off of AWS or other cloud providers. 

Do they have an AWS account that they provision with their software on ec2 instances (or something), and then they give you access to it? Or do they act as consultants who come in and install ClickHouse on your own AWS account?

Any success story from Microsoft Feature Stores?,"The idea is great: build once and use everywhere. But for MS Feature Store, it requires a single flat file as source for any given feature set. 

That means if I need multiple data sources, I need write code to connect to the various data sources, merge them, flatten them into a single file -- all of them done outside of Feature Stores.

For me, it creates inefficiency as the raw flattened file is created solely for the purpose of transformation within feature store. 

Plus when there is a mismatch in granularity or non-overlapping domain, I have to create different flattened files for different feature sets. That seems to be more hassles than whatever merit it may bring.

Recommendations for a new grad,"Hello all, I am looking for some advice on the reason of data engineering/data science (yes I know they are different). I will be graduating in May with a degree in Physics. During my time in school, I have spent considerable time doing independent study for Python, MATLAB, Java, and SQL. Due to financial constraints I am not able to pay for a certification course for these languages but I have taken free exams to get some sort of certificate that says I know what I'm talking about.

One of the best Fivetran alternative,"If you're urgently looking for a Fivetran alternative, this might help

Been seeing a lot of people here caught off guard by the new Fivetran pricing. If you're in eCommerce and relying on platforms like Shopify, Amazon, TikTok, or Walmart, the shift to MAR-based billing makes things really hard to predict and for a lot of teams, hard to justify.

If you’re in that boat and actively looking for alternatives, this might be helpful.

**Daton**, built by Saras Analytics, is an ETL tool specifically created for eCommerce. That focus has made a big difference for a lot of teams we’ve worked with recently who needed something that aligns better with how eComm brands operate and grow.

Here are a few reasons teams are choosing it when moving off Fivetran:

**Flat, predictable pricing**  
There’s no MAR billing. You’re not getting charged more just because your campaigns performed well or your syncs ran more often. Pricing is clear and stable, which helps a lot for brands trying to manage budgets while scaling.

**Retail-first coverage**  
Daton supports all the platforms most eComm teams rely on. Amazon, Walmart, Shopify, TikTok, Klaviyo and more are covered with production-grade connectors and logic that understands how retail data actually works.

**Built-in reporting**  
Along with pipelines, Daton includes Pulse, a reporting layer with dashboards and pre-modeled metrics like CAC, LTV, ROAS, and SKU performance. This means you can skip the BI setup phase and get straight to insights.

**Custom connectors without custom pricing**  
If you use a platform that’s not already integrated, the team will build it for you. No surprise fees. They also take care of API updates so your pipelines keep running without extra effort.

**Support that’s actually helpful**  
You’re not stuck waiting in a ticket queue. Teams get hands-on onboarding and responsive support, which is a big deal when you’re trying to migrate pipelines quickly and with minimal friction.

Most eComm brands start with a stack of tools. Shopify for the storefront, a few ad platforms, email, CRM, and so on. Over time, that stack evolves. You might switch CRMs, change ad platforms, or add new tools. But Shopify stays. It grows with you. Daton is designed with the same mindset. You shouldn't have to rethink your data infrastructure every time your business changes. It’s built to scale with your brand.

If you're currently evaluating options or trying to avoid a painful renewal, Daton might be worth looking into. I work with the Saras team and happy to help , here's the link if you want to checkout [https://www.sarasanalytics.com/saras-daton](https://www.sarasanalytics.com/saras-daton)

Address & Name matching technique,"Context: 
I have a dataset of company owned products like: Name: Company A, Address: 5th avenue, Product: A. 
Company A inc, Address: New york, Product B. 
Company A inc. , Address, 5th avenue New York, product C. 

I have 400 million entries like these. As you can see, addresses and names are in inconsistent formats. 
I have another dataset that will be me ground truth for companies. It has a clean name for the company along with it’s parsed address. 

The objective is to match the records from the table with inconsistent formats to the ground truth, so that each product is linked to a clean company. 



Questions and help: 
- i was thinking to use google geocoding api to parse the addresses and get geocoding. Then use the geocoding to perform distance search between my my addresses and ground truth BUT i don’t have the geocoding in the ground truth dataset. So, i would like to find another method to match parsed addresses without using geocoding. 

- Ideally, i would like to be able to input my parsed address and the name (maybe along with some other features like industry of activity) and get returned the top matching candidates from the ground truth dataset with a score between 0 and 1. Which approach would you suggest that fits big size datasets? 

- The method should be able to handle cases were one of my addresses could be: company A, address: Washington (meaning an approximate address that is just a city for example, sometimes the country is not even specified). I will receive several parsed addresses from this candidate as Washington is vague. What is the best practice in such cases? As the google api won’t return a single result, what can i do?

- My addresses are from all around the world, do you know if google api can handle the whole world? Would a language model be better at parsing for some regions? 

Help would be very much appreciated, thank you guys.

Dataverse vs. Azure SQL DB,"Thank you everyone with all of your helpful insights from my initial post! Just as the title states, I'm an intern looking to weigh the pros and cons of using Dataverse vs an Azure SQL Database (After many back and forths with IT, we've landed at these two options that were approved by our company). 

Our team plans to use Microsoft Power Apps to collect data and are now trying to figure out where to store the data. Upon talking with my supervisor, they plan to have data exported from this database to use for data analysis in SAS or RStudio, in addition to the Microsoft Power App.

Spark sql vs Redshift tiebreaker rules during sorting,"I’m looking to move some of my teams etl away from redshift and on to AWS glue.

Best setup report builder within SaaS?,"Hi everyone,

We've built a CRM and are looking to implement a report builder in our app.

We are exploring the best solutions for our needs and it seems like we have two paths we could take:

* Option A: Build the front-end/query builder ourselves and hit read-only replica
* Option B: Build the front-end/query builder ourselves and hit a data warehouse we've built using a key-base replication mechanism on BigQuery/Snowflake, etc..
* Option C: Use third party tools like Explo etc...

About the app:

* Our stack is React, Rails, Postgres.
* Our most used table (contacts) have 20,000,000 rows
* Some of our users have custom fields

We're trying to build something scalable but most importantly not spend months in this project.  
As a result, I'm wondering about the viability of Option A vs. Option B.  
  
One important point is how to manage custom fields that our users created on some objects.

We were thinking about, for contacts for example, we were thinking about simply running with joins across the following tables

* contacts
* contacts\_custom\_fields
* companies (and any other related 1:1 table so we can query fields from related 1:1 objects)
* contacts\_calculated\_fields (materialized view to compute values from 1:many relationship like # of deals the contacts is on)

So the two questions are:

* Would managing all this on the read-only be viable for our volume and a good starting point or will we hit the performance limits soon given our volume?
* Is managing custom fields this way the right way?",1,2,2025-04-15 19:28:35,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-15 19:28:35,19,Tuesday,257.0,1529,52.43,9,364,13.4,0,0,NEGATIVE,-0.991060197353363,"['everyone', 'weve', 'built', 'crm', 'looking', 'implement', 'report', 'builder', 'app', 'exploring', 'best', 'solutions', 'needs', 'seems', 'like', 'two', 'paths', 'could', 'take', 'option', 'build', 'frontendquery', 'builder', 'hit', 'readonly', 'replica', 'option', 'build', 'frontendquery', 'builder', 'hit', 'data', 'warehouse', 'weve', 'built', 'using', 'keybase', 'replication', 'mechanism', 'bigquerysnowflake', 'etc', 'option', 'use', 'third', 'party', 'tools', 'like', 'explo', 'etc', 'app', 'stack', 'react', 'rails', 'postgres', 'used', 'table', 'contacts', 'rows', 'users', 'custom', 'fields', 'trying', 'build', 'something', 'scalable', 'importantly', 'spend', 'months', 'project', 'result', 'wondering', 'viability', 'option', 'option', 'one', 'important', 'point', 'manage', 'custom', 'fields', 'users', 'created', 'objects', 'thinking', 'contacts', 'example', 'thinking', 'simply', 'running', 'joins', 'across', 'following', 'tables', 'contacts', 'contactscustomfields', 'companies', 'related', 'table', 'query', 'fields', 'related', 'objects', 'contactscalculatedfields', 'materialized', 'view', 'compute', 'values', 'many', 'relationship', 'like', 'deals', 'contacts', 'two', 'questions', 'would', 'managing', 'readonly', 'viable', 'volume', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'hit', 'performance', 'limits', 'soon', 'given', 'volume', 'managing', 'custom', 'fields', 'way', 'right', 'way']",everyone weve built crm looking implement report builder app exploring best solutions needs seems like two paths could take option build frontendquery builder hit readonly replica option build frontendquery builder hit data warehouse weve built using keybase replication mechanism bigquerysnowflake etc option use third party tools like explo etc app stack react rails postgres used table contacts rows users custom fields trying build something scalable importantly spend months project result wondering viability option option one important point manage custom fields users created objects thinking contacts example thinking simply running joins across following tables contacts contactscustomfields companies related table query fields related objects contactscalculatedfields materialized view compute values many relationship like deals contacts two questions would managing readonly viable volume good starting point hit performance limits soon given volume managing custom fields way right way,Mid,1,1,"data, like, use, would, get, want, new, also, way, make, etc, something, better, one, help, snowflake, databricks, lot, best, find, team, build, think, used, seems, might, process, able, done, solution, code, approach, right, google, start, since, instead, many, another, big, everything, thats, multiple, questions, however, similar, redshift, part, wondering, two, model, youre, based, tried, problem, understand, open, easy, whats, teams, maybe, real, sources, idea, tests, full, issues, stuff, try, useful, within, product, functions, next, implement, various, thinking, high, creating, version, hope, basically, input, step, options, context, fit, production, super, moving, drop, reports, pay, worth, community, related, search, sense, lake, documentation, quality, struggling, following, comes, modeling, makes, helps, results, clean, test, several, gets, limited, important, structures, early, thought, prefer, pricing, necessary, base, apply, delta, whole, side, ways, considering, task, along, whether, certain, put, group, learned, place, fivetran, plan, plus, internal, definitely, asked, pain, git, migrate, guidance, keeping, saas, entire, involves, lineage, client, looks, couple, considered, value, heres, regarding, writing, ingesting, control, arent, top, ideally, syntax, expensive, downstream, ideas, evolve, facing, rather, total, online, initial, windows, adf, mean, painful, personally, behind, expect, sample, tested, required, explore, huge, warehouses, somewhere, website, purpose, hit, topic, present, risk, implementing, relevant, wasnt, consider, infrastructure, replace, low, cons, practical, mechanism, party, bad, observability, identify, scraping, marketing, fix, vendor, replication, entry, approaches, sort, inputs, wed, logging, zero, somehow, email, written, designed, normally, pass, ease, perhaps, medallion, benchmark, nothing, engagement, non, choice, mess, recovery, steps, customer, failed, standard, amount, tsql, servers, needing, optimizing, extra, lists, lately, obvious, visual, matching, showing, clients, play, powerbi, problems, businesses, legacy, implementation, relying, automation, magic, decided, stat, eventually, automating, scala",7.7,7.0,150.9,-0.663,921.0,50.8,8.5,225.4,9.7,21.4,16.7,83,183,70,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

"bigquery/sheet/tableau, need for advice","Hello everyone,

I recently joined a project that uses BigQuery for data storage, dbt for transformations, and Tableau for dashboarding. I'd like some advice on improving our current setup.

# Current Architecture

* Data pipelines run transformations using dbt
* Data from BigQuery is synchronized to Google Sheets
* Tableau reports connect to these Google Sheets (not directly to BigQuery)
* Users can modify tracking values directly in Google Sheets

# The Problems

1. **Manual Process**: Currently, the Google Sheets and Tableau connections are created manually during development
2. **Authentication Issues**: In development, Tableau connects using the individual developer's account credentials
3. **Orchestration Concerns**: We have Google Cloud Composer for orchestration, but the Google Sheets synchronization happens separately

# Questions

1. What's the best way to automate the creation and configuration of Google Sheets in this workflow? Is there a Terraform approach or another IaC solution?
2. How should we properly manage connection strings in tableau between environments, especially when moving from development (using personal accounts) to production?

Is it possible to generate an open-table/metadata store that combines multiple data sources?,"I've recently learned about open-table paradigm, which if I am interpreting correctly, is essentially a mechanism for storing metadata so that the data associated with it can be efficiently looked up and retrieved. (Please correct this understanding if it is wrong). 

My question is whether or not you could have a single metadata store or open-table that combines metadata from two different storage solutions, so that you could query both from a single CLI tool using SQL like syntax?

API Help,"Hello, I am working on a personal ETL project with a beginning goal of trying to ingest data from Google Books API and batch insert into pg.  


Currently I have a script that cleans the API result into a list which is then inserted into pg. But, I have many repeat values each time I run this query, resulting in no data being inserted into pg.

I also notice that I get very random books that are not at all on topic for what I specific with my query parameters. e.g. title='data' and author=' '. 

  
I am wondering if anybody knows how to get only relevant data with API calls, as well as non duplicate value with each run of the script (eg persistent pagination).

  
Example of a \~320 book query.

In the first result I get somewhat data-related books. However, in the second result i get results such as: ""Homoeopathic Journal of Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Paedology"".

I understand that this is a broad query, but when I specify I end up getting very few book results(\~40-80), which is surprising because I figured a Google API would have more data. 

I may be doing this wrong, but any advice is very much appreciated.

"Event sourcing isn’t about storing history. it’s about replaying it.
Discussion","Replay isn’t just about fixing broken systems. It’s about rethinking how we build them in the first place. If your data architecture is driven by immutable events instead of current state, then replay stops being a recovery mechanism and starts becoming a way to continuously reshape, refine, and evolve your system with zero fear of breaking things.

Let’s talk about replay :)

**Event sourcing is misunderstood**  
For most developers, event sourcing shows up as a safety mechanism. It’s there to recover from a failure, rebuild a read model, trace an audit trail, or get through a schema change without too much pain. Replay is something you reach for in the rare cases when things go sideways.

That’s how it’s typically treated. A fallback. Something reactive.

But that lens is narrow. It frames replay as an emergency tool instead of something more fundamental. When events are treated as the source of truth, replay can become a normal, repeatable part of development. Not just a way to recover, but a way to refine.

**What if replay wasn’t just for emergencies?**  
What if it was a routine, even joyful, part of building your system?

Instead of treating replay as a recovery mechanism, you treat it as a development tool. Something you use to evolve your data models, improve your business logic, and shape entirely new views of your data over time. And more excitingly, it means you can derive entirely new schemas from your event history whenever your needs change.

**Why replay is so hard in most setups**  
Here’s the catch. In most event-sourced systems, **events are emitted after your app logic runs**. Your API gets the request, updates the database, and only then emits a change event. That event is a side effect, not the source of truth.

So when you want to replay, it gets tricky. You need replay-safe logic. You need to carefully version events. You need infrastructure to reprocess historical data. And you have to make absolutely sure you’re not double-applying anything.

That’s why replay often feels fragile. It’s not that the idea is bad. It’s just hard to pull off.

**But what if you flip the model?**  
What if events come first, not last?

That’s the approach we took.

A user action, like creating a user, updating an address, or assigning a tag, sends an event. That event is immediately appended to an immutable event store, **and only then** is it passed along to the application API to validate and store in the database.

Suddenly your database isn’t your source of truth. It’s just a read model. A fast, disposable output of your event stream.

So when you want to evolve your logic or reshape your data structure, all you have to do is update your flow, delete the old database, and press replay.

That’s it.

No migrations.  
No fragile ETL jobs.  
No one-off backfills.  
Just replay your history into the new shape.

**Your data becomes fluid**  
Say you’re running an e-commerce platform, and six months in, you realize you never tracked the discount code a customer used at checkout. It wasn’t part of the original schema. Normally, this would mean a migration, a painful manual backfill (if the data even still exists), or writing a fragile script to stitch it in later, assuming you’re lucky enough to recover it.

But with a full event history, you don’t need to hack anything.

You just update your flow logic to extract the discount code from the original checkout events. Then replay them.

Within minutes, your entire dataset is updated. The new field is populated everywhere it should have been, as if it had been there from day one.

**Your database becomes what it was always meant to be**  
A cache.  
Not a source of truth.  
Something you can throw away and rebuild without fear.  
You stop treating your schema like a delicate glass sculpture and start treating it like software.

**Replay unlocks AI-native data (with MCP Servers)**  
Most application databases are optimized for transactions, not understanding. They’re normalized, rigid, and shaped around application logic, not meaning. That’s fine for serving an app. But for AI? Nope.

Language models thrive on context. They need denormalized, readable structures. They need relationships spelled out. They need the why, not just the what.

When you have an event history, not just state but actions and intent. You can replay those events into entirely new shapes. You can build read models that are tailored specifically for AI: flattened tables for semantic search, user-centric structures for chat interfaces, agent-friendly layouts for reasoning.

And it’s not just one-and-done. You can reshape your models over and over as your use cases evolve. No migrations. No backfills. Just a new flow and a replay.

What is even more interesting is that with the help of MCP Servers AI can help you do this. By interrogating the event history with natural language prompts, it can suggest new model structures, flag gaps, and uncover meaning you didn’t plan for. It’s a feedback loop: replay helps AI make sense of your data, and AI helps you decide how to replay.

And none of this works without events that store intent. Current state is just a snapshot. Events tell the story.

**So, why doesn’t everyone build this way?**  
Because it’s hard. You need immutable storage. Replay-safe logic. Tools to build and maintain read models. Schema evolution support. Observability. Infrastructure to safely reprocess everything.

The architecture has been around for a while — Martin Fowler helped popularize event sourcing nearly two decades ago. But most teams ran into the same issue: implementing it well was too complex for everyday use.

That’s the reason behind the Flowcore Platform To make this kind of architecture not just possible, but effortless. Flowcore handles the messy parts. The ingestion, the immutability, the reprocessing, the flow management, the replay. So you can just build. You send an event, define what you want done with it, and replay it whenever you need to improve.",0,3,2025-04-15 15:55:44,0,False,2025-04-15 16:09:47,False,False,2025-04-15

Refactoring a script taking 17hours to run wit 0 Documentation,"Hey guys, I am a recent graduate working in data engineering. The company has poor processes and also poor documentation, the main task that I will be working on is refactoring and optimizing a script that basically re conciliates assets and customers (logic a bit complex as their supply chain can be made off tens of steps).

The current data is stored in Redshift and it's a mix of transactional and master data. I spent a lot of times going through the script (python script using psycopg2 to orchestrate execute the queries) and one of the things that struck me is that there is no incremental processing, each time the whole tracking of the supply chain gets recomputed.

I have poor guidance from my manager as he never worked on it so I am a bit lost on the methodology side. The tool is huge (hundreds of queries with more than 4000 lines, queries with over 10 joins and all the bad practices that you can think of).

"Whats the simplest/fastest way to bulk import 100s of CSVs each into their OWN table in SSMS? (Using SSIS, command prompt, or possibly python)","Example: I want to import 100 CSVs into 100 SSMS tables (that are not pre-created). The datatypes can be varchar for all (unless it could autoassign some).

I'd like to just point the process to a folder with the CSVs and read that into a specific database + schema. Then the table name just becomes the name of the file (all lower case).

What's the simplest solution here? I'm positive it can be done in either SSIS or Python. But my C skill for SSIS are lacking (maybe I can avoid a C script?). In python, I had something kind of working, but it takes way too long (10+ hours for a csv thats like 1gb).

Criticism at work because my lack of understanding business requirements is coinciding with quick turnaround times,"Hi,

I'm looking for sincere advice.

I'm basically a data/analytics engineer. My tasks generally are like this

1. put configurations so that the source dataset can ingest and preprocess into aws s3 in correct file format. I've noticed sometimes filepath names randomly change without warning which would cause configs to change so I would have to be cognizant of that. 

2. the s3 output is then put into a mapping tool (which in my experience is super slow and frequently annoying to use) we have to map source -> our schema

3. once you update things in the mapping tool, it SHOULD export automatically to S3 and show in production environment after refresh, which is usually. However, keyword should. There are times where my data didn't show up and it turned out I have to 'manually export' a file to S3 without being made aware beforehand which files require manual export and which ones occur automatically through our pipeline

4. I then usually have to develop a SQL view that combines data from various sources for different purposes

The issues I'm facing lately....

A colleague left end of last year and I've noticed that my workload has dramatically changed. I've been given tasks that I can only assume were once hers from another colleague. The thing is the tasks I'm given:

1. Have zero documentation. I have no clue what the task is meant to accomplish

2. I have very vague understanding of the source data 

3. Just go off of an either previously completed script, which sometimes suffers from major issues (too many subqueries, thousands of lines of code). Try to realistically manage how/if to refactor vs. using same code and 'coming back to it later' if I have time constraints. After using similar code, randomly realize the requirements of old script changed b/c my data doesn't populate in which I have to ask my boss what the issue 

4. Me and my boss have to navigate various excel sheets and communication to play 'guess work' as to what the requirements are so we can get something out 

5. Review them with the colleague who assigned it to me who points out things are wrong OR randomly changes the requirements that causes me to make more changes and then expresses frustration 'this is unacceptable', 'this is getting delayed', 'I am getting frustrated' continuously that is making me uncomfortable in asking questions.

I do not directly interact with the stakeholders. The colleague I just mentioned is the person who does and translates requirements back. I really, honestly have no clue what is going through the stakeholders mind or how they intend to use the product. All I frequently hear is that 'they are not happy', 'I am frustrated', 'this is too slow'. I am expected to get things out within few hours to 1-2 business days. This doesn't give me enough time to ensure if I made many mistakes in the process. I will take accountability that I have made some mistakes in this process by fixing things then not checking and ensuring things are as expected that caused further delays. Overall, I am under constant pressure to churn things out ASAP and I'm struggling to keep up and feel like many mistakes are a result of the pressure to do things fast.

I have told my boss and colleague in detail (even wrote it up) that it would be helpful for me to: 1. just have 1-2 sentences as to what this project is trying to accomplish 2. better documentation.  People have agreed with me but they have not really done much b/c everybody is too busy to document since once one project is done, I'm pulled into the next. I personally am observing a technical debt problem here, but I am new to my job and new to data engineering (was previously in a different analytics role) so I am trying to figure out if this is a me issue and where I can take accountability or this speaks to broader issues with my team and I should consider another job. I am honestly thinking about starting the job search again in a few months, but I am quite discouraged with my current experience and starting to notice signs of burnout.",5,1,2025-04-16

migrating from No-Code middleware platform to another more fundamental tech stack,"Hey everyone, 

we are a company that relies heavy on a so called no-code middleware that combines many different aspects of typical data engineering stuff into one big platform. However we have found ourselves (finally) in the situation that we need to migrate to a lets say more fundamental tech stack that relies more on knowledge about programming, databases and sql. I wanted to ask if someone has been in the same situation and what their experiences have been. Our only option right now is to migrate for business reasons and it will happen, the only question is what we are going to use and how we will use it. 

**Background:**  
We use this platform as our main ""engine"" or tool to map various business proccess. The platform includes creation and management of various kinds of ""connectors"" including Http, as2, mail, x400 and whatnot. You can then create profiles that can get fetch and transform data based on what comes in by one of the connectors and load the data directly into your database, create files or do whatever the business logic requires. The platform provides a comprehensive amount of logging and administration. In my honest opinion, that is quite a lot that this tool can offer. Does anyone know any kind of other tool that can do the same? I heard about Apache Airflow or Apache Nifi but only on the surface. 

The same platform we are using right now has another software solution for building database entities on top of its own database structure to create ""input masks"" for users to create, change or read data and also apply business logic. We use this tool to provide whole platforms and even ""build"" basic websites. 

What would be the best tech stack to migrate to if your goal was to cover all of the above? I mean there probably is not an all in one solution but that is not what we are looking for right now. If you said to me that for example apache nifi in combination with python would be enough to cover everything our middleware provided would be more than enough for me.  
  
What is essential for us is also a good logging capability. We need to make sure that whatever data flows are happening or have happended is comprehensible in case of errors or questions. 

For input masks and simple web platforms we are currently using C# Blazor and have multiple projects that are working very well, which we could also migrate to.

Obtaining accurate and valuable datasets for Uni project related to social media analytics.,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working on my final project titled **“The Evolution of Social Media Engagement: Trends Before, During, and After the COVID-19 Pandemic.”**

I’m specifically looking for **free datasets** that align with this topic, but I’ve been having trouble finding ones that are accessible without high costs — especially as a full-time college student. Ideally, I need to be able to **download the data as CSV files** so I can import them into **Tableau** for visualizations and analysis.

Here are a few research questions I’m focusing on:

1. How did engagement levels on major social media platforms change between the early and later stages of the pandemic?
2. What patterns in user engagement (e.g., time of day or week) can be observed during peak COVID-19 months?
3. Did social media engagement decline as vaccines became widely available and lockdowns began to ease?

I’ve already found a couple of datasets on **Kaggle** (linked below), and I may use some information from **gs.statcounter**, though that data seems a bit too broad for my needs.

If anyone knows of any other relevant **free data sources**, or has suggestions on where I could look, I’d really appreciate it!

Did anyone manage to create Debezium server iceberg sink with GCS?,"Hello everyone,

Our infra setup for CDC looks like this:

MySQL > Debezium connectors > Kafka > Sink (built in house > BigQuery 

Recently I came across Debezium server iceberg:  [https://github.com/memiiso/debezium-server-iceberg/tree/master](https://github.com/memiiso/debezium-server-iceberg/tree/master), and it looks promising as it cuts the Kafka part and it ingests the data directly to Iceberg. 

My problem is to use Iceberg in GCS. I know that there is the BigLake metastore that can be used, which i tested with BigQuery and it works fine. The issue I'm facing is to properly configure the BigLake metastore in my application.properties. 

In Iceberg [documentation](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/nightly/kafka-connect/#google-gcs-configuration-example) they are showing something like this:

    ""iceberg.catalog.type"": ""rest"",
    ""iceberg.catalog.uri"": ""https://catalog:8181"",
    ""iceberg.catalog.warehouse"": ""gs://bucket-name/warehouse"",
    ""iceberg.catalog.io-impl"": ""org.apache.iceberg.google.gcs.GCSFileIO""

But I'm not sure if BigLake has exposed REST APIs? I tried to use the REST point that i used for creating the catalog

Best practice for unified cloud cost attribution (Databricks + Azure)?,"Hi! I’m working on a FinOps initiative to improve cloud cost visibility and attribution across departments and projects in our data platform. We do tagging production workflows on department level and can get a decent view in Azure Cost Analysis by filtering on tags like department: X. But I am struggling to bring Databricks into that picture — especially when it comes to SQL Serverless Warehouses.

My goal is to be able to print out: total project cost = azure stuff + sql serverless.

**Questions**:

**1. Tagging Databricks SQL Warehouses for Attribution**

Is creating a separate SQL Warehouse per department/project the only way to track department/project usage or is there any other way? 



**2. Joining Azure + Databricks Costs**

Is there a clean way to join usage data from Azure Cost Analysis with Databricks billing data (e.g., from system.billing.usage)?

error handling with sql constraints?,"i am building a pipeline that writes data to a sql table (in azure). currently, the pipeline cleans the data in python, and it uses the pandas to_sql() method to write to sql.

i wanted to enforce constraints on the sql table, but im struggling with error handling.

for example, suppose column X has a value of -1, but there is a sql table constraint requiring X > 0. when the pipelines tries to write to sql, it throws a generic error msg that doesn’t specify the problematic column(s).

is there a way to get detailed error msgs?

or, more generally, is there a better way to go about enforcing data validity?

thanks all! :)

Best solution for creating list of user-id,"Hi data specialist,

with colleagues we are debating what would be the best solution to create list of users-id giving simple criterions.

let's take an example of line we have

    ID,GROUP,NUM
    01,group1,0.2
    02,group1,0.4
    03,group2,0.5
    04,group1,0.6
    

let say we only want the subset of user id that are part of the group1 and that have NUM > 0.3 ; it will give us 02 and 04.

We have currently theses list in S3 parquet (partionned by GROUP, NUM or other dimensionq). We want results in plain CSV files in S3. We have really a lot of it (multi billions of rows). Other constraints are we want to create theses sublist every hours (giving the fact that source are constantly changing) so relatively fast, also we have multiple ""select"" criterions and finally want to keep cost under control.

Currently we fill a big AWS Redshift cluster where we load our inputs from the datalake and make big select to output lists. It worked but clearly show its limits. Adding more dimension will definitely kill it. 

I was thinking this not a good fit as Redshift is a column oriented analytic DB. Personally I would advocate for using spark (with EMR) to directly <filter and produce S3 files. Some are arguing that we could use another Database. Ok but which? (I don't really get the why)

ISO Advice: I want to create an app/software for specific data pipeline. Where should I start?,"Hello! I have a very good understanding of Google Sheets and Excel but for the workflow I want to create, I think I need to consider learning Big Query or something else similar. 

  
The main challenge I foresee is due to the columnar design (5k-7k columns) and I would really really like to be able to keep this. I have made versions of this using the traditional row design but I very quickly got to 10,000+ rows and the filter functions were too time consuming to apply consistently. 

  
What do you think is the best way for me to make progress? Should I basically go back to school and learn Big Query, SQL and data engineering? Or, is there another way you might recommend?

Your Teams Development Approach,"Currently I am wondering how other teams do their development and especially testing their pipelines.

I am the sole data engineer at a medical research institute. We do everything on premise, mostly in windows world. Due to me being self taught and having no other engineers to learn from I keep implementing things the same way:

Step 1: Get some source data and do some exploration

Step 2: Design a pipeline and a model that is the foundation for the README file

Step 3: Write the main ETL script and apply some defensive programming principles

Step 4: Run the script on my sample data which would have two outcomes:

1. Everything went well? Okay, add more data and try again!

2. Something breaks? See if it is a data quality or logic error, add some nice error handling and run again!

At some point the script will run on all the currently known source data and can be released. Over the course of the process I will add logging, some DQ checks on the DB and add alerting for breaking errors. I try to keep my README up to date with my thought process and how the pipeline works and push it to our self hosted Gitea.

I tried tinkering around with pytest and added some unit tests for complicated deserialization or source data that requires external knowledge. But when I tried setting up integration testing and end to end testing it always felt like so much work. Trying to keep my test environments up to date while also delivering new solutions seems to always end up with me cutting corners on testing. 

At this point I suspect that there might be some way to make this whole testing setup more reproducable and less manual. I really want to be able to onboard new people, if we ever hire, and not let them face an untestable mess of legacy code.

Any input is highly appreciated!

Data Mapping,"We have created an AI model and algorithms that enable us to map an organisations data landscape. This is because we found all data catalogs fell short of context to be able to enable purpose-based governance.

Effectively, it enables us to map and validate all data purposes, processing activities, business processes, data uses, data users, systems and service providers automatically without stakeholder workshops - but we are struggling with the last hurdle. 

We are attempting to use the data context to infer (with help from scans of core environments) data fields, document types, business logic, calculations and metrics. We want to create an anchor ""data asset"". 

The difficulty we are having is how do we define the data assets. We need that anchor definition to enable cross-functional utility, so it can't be linked to just one concept (ie purpose, use, process, rights). This is because the idea is that:
- lawyers can use it for data rights and privacy
- technology can use it for AI, data engineering and cyber security 
- commercial can use it for data value, opportunities, decision making and strategy 
- operations can use it for efficiency and automation


We are thinking we need a ""master definition"" that clusters related fields / key words / documents and metrics to uses, processes etc. and then links that to context, but how do we create the names of the clusters! 

Everything we try falls flat, semantic, contextual, etc. All the data catalogs we have tested don't seem to help us actually define the data assets - it assumes you have done this! 

Can anyone tell me how they have done this at thier organisation? Or how you approached defining the data assets you have?

Vibe Coding in Data Engineering — Microsoft Fabric Test,"Recently, I came across ""Vibe Coding"". The idea is cool, you need to use only LLM integrated with IDE like Cursor for software development. I decided to do the same but in the data engineering area. In the link you can find a description of my tests in MS Fabric. 

I'm wondering about your experiences and advices how to use LLM to support our work.

"LLMs, ML and Observability mess","Anyone else find that building reliable LLM applications involves managing significant complexity and unpredictable behavior?

It seems the era where basic uptime and latency checks sufficed is largely behind us for these systems.

Tracking response quality, detecting hallucinations *before* they impact users, and managing token costs effectively – key operational concerns for production LLMs. All needs to be monitored...

There are *so many* tools, every day a new shiny object comes up - **how do you go about choosing your tracing/ observability stack?**

Honestly, I wasn't sure how to go about building evals and tracing in a good way.  
I reached out to a friend who runs one of those observability startups.

That's what he had to say -

The core message was that robust observability requires multiple layers.  
**1. Tracing** (to understand the full request lifecycle),  
**2. Metrics** (to quantify performance, cost, and errors),  
**3 .Quality/Eval** evaluation (critically assessing response validity and relevance),  
4. and **Insights** (to drive iterative improvements - ie what would you do with the data you observe?).

All in all - *how do you go about setting up your approach for LLMObservability?*

Oh, and the full conversation with Traceloop's CTO about obs tools and approach [is here](https://youtu.be/-Bbvd8cbjac) :)

"Best storage option for high-frequency time-series data (100 Hz, multiple producers)?","Hi all, I’m building a data pipeline where sensor data is published via PubSub and processed with Apache Beam. Each producer sends 100 sensor values every 10 ms (100 Hz). I expect up to 10 producers, so ~30 GB/day total. Each producer should write to a separate table (no cross-correlation).

Requirements:

•	Scalable (horizontally, more producers possible) 

•	Low-maintenance / serverless preferred

•	At least 1 year of retention

•	Ability to download a full day’s worth of data per producer with a button click

•	No need for deep analytics, just daily visualization in a web UI

BigQuery seems like a good fit due to its scalability and ease of use, but I’m wondering if there are better alternatives for long-term high-frequency time-series data.

Star schema implementation in Glue + Redshift.,"I'm setting up a Glue (Spark) to Redshift pipeline with incremental SQL loads, and while fact tables are straightforward (just append new records), dimension tables are more complex to be honest - I have a few questions regarding the practical implementation of a star schema data warehouse model ?   
  
First, avoiding duplicates, transactional facts won't have this issue because they will be unique, but for dimensions it is not the case,  do you pre-filter in Spark (reads existing Redshift dim tables and ensure new chunks of dim tables are new records) or just dump everything to Redshift and let it deduplicate (let Redshift handle upinserts)?   
  
Second, surrogate keys, they have to be globally unique across all the table because they will serve as primary keys, do you generate them in Spark (risk collisions across job runs) or use Redshift IDENTITY for example?   
  
Third, SCD Type 2: implement change detection in Spark (comparing new vs old records) or handle it in Redshift (with MERGE/triggers)? Would love to hear real-world experiences on what actually scales, especially for large dimensions (10M+ rows) - how do you balance the Spark vs Redshift work while keeping everything consistent?

Last but not least I want to know how to ensure fact tables are properly pointing to dimension tables, do we fill the foreign key column in spark before loading to redshift? 

PS: if you have any learning resources with practical implementations and best practices in place please provide them, because I feel the majority of the info on the web is theoretical.

Stuck at JSONL files in AWS S3 in middle of pipeline,"I am building a pipeline for the first time, using dlt, and it's kind of... janky. I feel like an imposter, just copying and pasting stuff into a zombie.

Ideally: SFTP (.csv) -> AWS S3 (.csv) -> Snowflake

Currently: I keep getting a JSONL file in the s3 bucket, which would be okay if I could get it into Snowflake table

* SFTP -> AWS: this keeps giving me a JSONL file
* AWS S3 -> Snowflake: I keep getting errors, where it is not reading the JSONL file deposited here

Other attempts to find issue:

* Local CSV file -> Snowflake: I am able to do this using read\_csv\_duckdb(), but not read\_csv()
* CSV manually moved to AWS -> Snowflake: I am able to do this with read\_csv()
* so I can probably do it directly SFTP -> Snowflake, but I want to be able to archive the files in AWS, which seems like best practice?

There are a few clients, who periodically drop new files into their SFTP folder. I want to move all of these files (plus new files and their file date) to AWS S3 to archive it. From there, I want to move the files to Snowflake, before transformations.

When I get the AWS middle point to work, I plan to create one table for each client in Snowflake, where new data is periodically appended / merged / upserted to existing data.

"A databricks project, a tight deadline, and a PIP.","Hey r/dataengineering, I need your help to find a solution to my dumpster fire and potentially save a soul (or two)).

I'm working together with an older dev who has been put on a project and it's a mess left behind by contractors. I noticed he's on some kind of PIP thing, and the project has a set deadline which is not realistic. It could be both of us are set up to fail. The code is the worst I have seen in my ten years in the field. No tests, no docs, a mix of prod and test, infra mixed with application code, a misunderstanding of how classes and scope work, etc.

The project itself is a ""library"" that syncing databricks with data from an external source. We query the external source and insert data into databricks, and every once in a while query the source again for changes (for sake of discussion, lets assume these are page reads per user) which need to be done incrementally. We also frequently submit new jobs to the external source with the same project. what we ingest from the source is not a lot of data, usually under 1 million rows and rarely over 100k a day. 

Roughly 75% of the code is doing computation in python for databricks, where they first pull out the dataframe and then filter it down with python and spark. The remaining 25% is code to wrap the API on the external source. All code lives in databricks and is mostly vanilla python. It is called from a notebook. (...)

My only idea is that the ""library"" should be split instead of having to do everything. The ingestion part of the source can be handled by dbt and we can make that work first. The part that holds the logic to manipulate the dataframes and submit new jobs to the external api is buggy and I feel it needs to be gradually rewritten, but we need to double the features to this part of the code base if we are to make the deadline. 

I'm already pushing back on the deadline and I'm pulling in another DE to work on this, but I am wondering what my technical approach should be.",5,5,2025-04-17

Databricks in Excel,"Anyone have any experience or ideas getting Databricks data into Excel aside from the ODBC spark driver or whatever? 

I've seen an uptick for requests for raw data for other teams to do data discovery and scoping out future PBI dashboards but it has been a little cumbersome to get them set up with the driver, connected to compute clusters, added to Unity Catalog, etc. Most of them are not SQL experienced so in the past when we had regular Azure SQL we would create views or tables for them to pull into Excel to do their work.

I have a few instances where I drop a csv file to a storage account and then shuffle those around to SharePoint or other locations using a logic app but was wondering if anyone had better ideas before I got too committed to that method.

We also considered backloading some data into a downsized Azure SQL instance because it plays better with Excel but it seems like a step backwards.

High cardinality meets columnar time series system,"Wrote a blog post based on my experiences working with high-cardinality telemetry data and the challenges it poses for storage and query performance.

The post dives into how using **Apache Parquet** and a **columnar-first design** helps mitigate these issues, by isolating cardinality per column, enabling better compression, selective scans, and avoiding the combinatorial blow-up seen in time-series or row-based systems.

It includes some complexity analysis and practical examples. Thought it might be helpful for anyone dealing with observability pipelines, log analytics, or large-scale event data.

Exploring a DAAS Business Opportunity in Geospatial Data—Where to Start?,"Hey Reddit,

I currently work as a BA/project lead in the ESG space, and I’ve spotted a business gap in the geospatial data industry that I’d love to explore as a potential DAAS (Data-as-a-Service) venture.

I have solid product ownership and requirements gathering skills, understand the data sources well, and have a good grasp of database structuring. 

However, I don't have coding skills—so I’m wondering how best to approach this.
Where would you start if you were in my shoes?

Additionally, any recommendations for low-code/no-code data platforms that could help me build an MVP myself would be hugely appreciated! Open to general advice too.

Data Pipeline Question,"I'm fairly new to the idea of ETL even though I've read about and followed it for years; however, the implementation is what I have a question about.

Our needs have migrated towards the idea of Spark so I'm thinking of building our pipeline in Scala.  I've used it on and off in the past so it's not a foreign language for me.

However, the question I have is should I build our workflow and hard code it from A-Z (data ingestion, create or replace, populate tables) outside of snowflake, or is it better practice to have it fragmented and saved as snowflake worksheets?  My aim with this change would be strongly typed services that can't be ""accidentally"" fired off.

I'm thinking the pipeline would be more of a spot instance that is fired off with certain configs with the A-Z only allowed for certain logins.  There aren't many people on the team but there are people working with tables that have drop permissions (not from me) and I just want to be prepared for disasters and recovery.

It's like a mini-dream whereas I'm in full control of the data and ingestion pipelines but everything is sql currently.  Therefore, we are building from scratch right now and the Scala system would mainly be a disaster recovery so made to repopulate tables, or to ingest a new set of raw data to be transformed and loaded (updates).

This is a non-profit so I don't want to load them up with huge bills (databricks) so I do want to do most of the stuff myself with the help of apache.  I understand there are numerous options but essentially it's going to be like this

Scala server -> Apache Spark -> ML Categorization From Spark -> Snowflake

Since we are ingesting data I figured we should mix in the machine learning while transforming and processing to save on time and headaches.

WHY I DIDN'T CHOOSE SNOWPARK:  
After looking over snowpark I see it as a great gateway for people either needing pure speed, or those who are newer to software engineering and needing a box to be in.  I'm well-versed in pandas, numpy, etc. so I wanted to be able to break the mold at any point.  I know this may not be preferable for snowflake people but I have about a decade of experience writing complex software systems, and I didn't want vendor lock-in so I hope that can be respected to some extent.  If I am blatantly wrong then please let me know how snowpark is better.  

  
Note: I do see snowpark offers Scala (or something like that); however, the point isn't solely to use Scala, I come from Golang and want a sturdy pipeline that won't run into breaking changes and make it a JVM shop.

Any other advice from engineers here on other things I should recommend would be greatly appreciated as well.  Scraping is a huge concern, which is why I chose Golang off the bat, but scraping new data can't objectively be the main priority, I feel like there are other things that I might be unaware of.  Maybe a checklist of things that I can make sure we have just so we don't run into major issues then I catch the blame shift.

Therefore, please be gentle I am not the most well-versed in data engineering but I do see it as a fascinating discipline that I'd like to find a niche in if possible.",2,1,2025-04-18

"MS ACCESS, no clickbait, kinda long","Hello to all,

Thank you for reading the following and talking the time to answer.

I'm a consultant and I work as...non idea what I am, maybe you'll tell me what I am.

In my current project (1+ years) I normally do stored procedures in tsql, I create reports towards Excel, sometimes powerbi, and...AND...AAAANNDDD * drums * Ms access (yeah, same as title says).

So many things happens inside ms access, mainly views from tsql and some...how can I call them? Like certain ""structures"" inside, made by a dude that was 7 years (yes, seven, S-E-V-E-N) on the project. These structures have a nice design with filters, with inputs, outputs. During this 1+ year I somehow made some modifications which worked (I was the first one surprised, most of the times I had no idea what I was doing, but it was working and nobody complained so, *shoulder pat* to me).

The thing is that I enjoy all the (buzz word incoming) * ✨️✨️✨️automation✨️✨️✨️"" like the jobs, the procedures that do stuff etc. I enjoy tsql, is very nice. It can do a lot of shit (still trying to figure out how to send automatic mails, some procedures done by the previous dude already send emails with csv inside, for now it's black magic for me). The jobs and their schedule is pure magic. It's nice. 

Here comes the actual dilemma:

I want to do stuff. I'm taking some courses on SSIS (for now it seems it does the same as a stored procedures with extra steps+no code, but I trust the process).

How can I replace the entire ms access tool? How can I create a menu with stuff, like ""Sales, Materials, Aquisitions"" etc, where I have to put filters (as end user) to find shit. 

For every data eng. positions i see instruments required such as sql, no sql, postgresql, mongodb, airflow, snowflake, apake, hadoop, databricks, python, pyspark, Tableau, powerbi, click, aws, azure, gcp, my mother's virginity. I've taken courses (coursera / udemy) on almost all and they don't do magic. It seems they do pretty much what tsql can do (except ✨️✨️✨️ cloud ✨️✨️✨️).

In python I did some things, mainly stuff about very old excel format files, since they come from a sap Oracle cloud, they come sometimes with rows/columns positioned where they shouldn't have been, so, I stead of the 99999+ rows of VBA script my predecessor did, I use 10 rows of python to do the same.

So, coming back to my question, is there something to replace Ms access? Keeping the simplicity and also the utility it has, but also ✨️✨️✨️future proof✨️✨️✨️, like, in 5 years when fresh people will come in my place (hopefully faster than 5y) they will have some contemporary technology to work with instead of stone age tools.

How Dirty Is Your Data?,"While I find these Buzzfeed-style quizzes somewhat… *gimmicky*, they do make it easy to reflect on how your team handles core parts of your analytics stack. How does your team stack up in these areas?

**Semantic Layer Documentation:**

**Data Testing:**

* ✅ Automated tests run prior to merging anything into main. Failed tests block the commit.
* 🟡 We do some manual testing.
* 🚩 We rely on users to tell us when something is wrong.

**Data Lineage:**

* ✅ We know where our data comes from.
* 🟡 We can trace data back a few steps, but then it gets fuzzy.
* 🚩 Data lineage? What's that?

**Handling Data Errors:**

* ✅ We feel confident our errors are reasonably limited by our tests. When errors come up, we are able to correct them and implement new tests as we see fit.
* 🟡 We fix errors as they come up, but don't track them.
* 🚩 We hope the errors go away on their own.

**Warehouse / RB Access Control:**

* ✅ Our roles are defined in code (Terraform, Pulumi, etc...) and are git controlled, allowing us to reconstruct who had access to what and when.
* 🟡 We have basic access controls, but could be better.
* 🚩 Everyone has access to everything.

**Communication with Data Consumers:**

* ✅ We communicate changes, but sometimes users are surprised.
* 🟡 We communicate major changes only.
* 🚩 We let users figure it out themselves.

Scoring: 

Each ✅ - 0 points, Each 🟡 - 1 point, Each 🚩 - 2 points.

DataPig - RIP spark,"Can you imagine a world where no more huge price to pay or determine data ingestion frequency so it won't be costly to move data raw files like CSV to target data warehouse like SQL server. That is pay per compute.. am paying to run 15 threads aka Spark Pool compute always so I can move 15 tables delta data to target..Now here comes DataPig.. They say can move 200 tables delta less than 10 seconds..

How according benchmark it takes 45 min to write 1 million rows data to target tables using Azure Synapse spark pool.. but DataPig does it 8 sec to stage data into SQL server for same data. With leveraging only target compute power eliminating pay to play on compute side of spark and they implemented multithreaded parallel processing aka parallel 40 threads processing 40 tables changes at same time. Delta ingestion to milliseconds from seconds. Persevering both CDC and keeping only latest data for data warehouse for application like D365 is bang for money.

Best tools for automation?,"I’ve been tasked at work with automating some processes — things like scraping data from emails with attached CSV files, or running a script that currently takes a couple of hours every few days.

I’m seeing this as a great opportunity to dive into some new tools and best practices, especially with a long-term goal of becoming a Data Engineer. That said, I’m not totally sure where to start, especially when it comes to automating multi-step processes — like pulling data from an email or an API, processing it, and maybe loading it somewhere maybe like a PowerBi Dashbaord or Excel.

Best way to sync RDS Posgtres Full load + CDC data?,"What would this data pipeline look like? The total data size is 5TB on postgres and it is for a typical SaaS B2B2C product

Here is what the part of the data pipeline looks like

1. Source DB: Postgres running on RDS
2. AWS Database migration service -> Streams parquet into a s3 bucket
3. We have also exported the full db data into a different s3 bucket - this time almost matches the CDC start time

What we need on the other end is a good cost effective data lake to do analytics and reporting on - as real time as possible

I tried to set something up with pyiceberg to go iceberg -

\- Iceberg tables mirror the schema of posgtres tables

\- Each table is partitioned by account\_id and created\_date

I was able to load the full data easily but handling the CDC data is a challenge as the updates are damn slow. It feels impractical now - I am not sure if I should just append data to iceberg and get the latest row version by some other technique?

how is this typically done? Copy on write or merge on read?

How do you balance short and long term as an IC,"Hi all ! I'm an analytics engineer not DE but felt it would be relevant to ask this here.

When you're taking on a new project, how do you think about balancing turning something around asap vs really digging in and understanding and possibly delivering something better? 

For example, I have a report I'm updating and adding to. On one extreme, I could probably ship the thing in like a week without much of an understanding outside of what's absolutely necessary to understand to add what needs to be added. 

On the other hand, I could pull the thread and work my way all the way from source system to queries that create the views to the transformations done in the reporting layer and understanding the business process and possibly modeling the data if that's not already done etc 

I know oftentimes I hear leaders of data teams talk about balancing short versus long-term investments, but even as an IC I wonder how y'all do it?

In a previous role, I aired on the side of understanding everything super deeply from the ground up on every project, but that means you don't deliver things quickly.",4,7,2025-04-20 15:54:48,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-20 15:54:48,15,Sunday,195.0,1105,55.61,6,281,15.2,0,0,NEGATIVE,-0.9987725615501404,"['analytics', 'engineer', 'felt', 'would', 'relevant', 'ask', 'youre', 'taking', 'new', 'project', 'think', 'balancing', 'turning', 'something', 'around', 'asap', 'really', 'digging', 'understanding', 'possibly', 'delivering', 'something', 'better', 'example', 'report', 'updating', 'adding', 'one', 'extreme', 'could', 'probably', 'ship', 'thing', 'like', 'week', 'without', 'much', 'understanding', 'outside', 'whats', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'understand', 'add', 'needs', 'added', 'hand', 'could', 'pull', 'thread', 'work', 'way', 'way', 'source', 'system', 'queries', 'create', 'views', 'transformations', 'done', 'reporting', 'layer', 'understanding', 'business', 'process', 'possibly', 'modeling', 'data', 'thats', 'already', 'done', 'etc', 'know', 'oftentimes', 'hear', 'leaders', 'data', 'teams', 'talk', 'balancing', 'short', 'versus', 'longterm', 'investments', 'even', 'wonder', 'yall', 'previous', 'role', 'aired', 'side', 'understanding', 'everything', 'super', 'deeply', 'ground', 'every', 'project', 'means', 'dont', 'deliver', 'things', 'quickly']",analytics engineer felt would relevant ask youre taking new project think balancing turning something around asap really digging understanding possibly delivering something better example report updating adding one extreme could probably ship thing like week without much understanding outside whats absolutely necessary understand add needs added hand could pull thread work way way source system queries create views transformations done reporting layer understanding business process possibly modeling data thats already done etc know oftentimes hear leaders data teams talk balancing short versus longterm investments even wonder yall previous role aired side understanding everything super deeply ground every project means dont deliver things quickly,Mid,1,1,"data, like, use, would, get, want, new, also, way, make, etc, something, better, one, help, snowflake, databricks, lot, best, find, team, build, think, used, seems, might, process, able, done, solution, code, approach, right, google, start, since, instead, many, another, big, everything, thats, multiple, questions, however, similar, redshift, part, wondering, two, model, youre, based, tried, problem, understand, open, easy, whats, teams, maybe, real, sources, idea, tests, full, issues, stuff, try, useful, within, product, functions, next, implement, various, thinking, high, creating, version, hope, basically, input, step, options, context, fit, production, super, moving, drop, reports, pay, worth, community, related, search, sense, lake, documentation, quality, struggling, following, comes, modeling, makes, helps, results, clean, test, several, gets, limited, important, structures, early, thought, prefer, pricing, necessary, base, apply, delta, whole, side, ways, considering, task, along, whether, certain, put, group, learned, place, fivetran, plan, plus, internal, definitely, asked, pain, git, migrate, guidance, keeping, saas, entire, involves, lineage, client, looks, couple, considered, value, heres, regarding, writing, ingesting, control, arent, top, ideally, syntax, expensive, downstream, ideas, evolve, facing, rather, total, online, initial, windows, adf, mean, painful, personally, behind, expect, sample, tested, required, explore, huge, warehouses, somewhere, website, purpose, hit, topic, present, risk, implementing, relevant, wasnt, consider, infrastructure, replace, low, cons, practical, mechanism, party, bad, observability, identify, scraping, marketing, fix, vendor, replication, entry, approaches, sort, inputs, wed, logging, zero, somehow, email, written, designed, normally, pass, ease, perhaps, medallion, benchmark, nothing, engagement, non, choice, mess, recovery, steps, customer, failed, standard, amount, tsql, servers, needing, optimizing, extra, lists, lately, obvious, visual, matching, showing, clients, play, powerbi, problems, businesses, legacy, implementation, relying, automation, magic, decided, stat, eventually, automating, scala",7.7,7.0,150.9,-0.663,921.0,50.8,8.5,225.4,9.7,21.4,16.7,83,183,70,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

Slowness of Small Data,"Got a meeting coming up with high profile data analysts at my org that primarily use SAS which doesn’t like large CSV or parquet (with their current version) drawing from MSSQL/otherMScrap. I can give them all their data, daily, (5gb parquet or whatever that is —more— as csv) right to their doorstep in secured Shaerpoint/OnDrive folders they can sync in their OS.

Their primary complaint is slowness of SAS drawing data.  They also seem misguided with their own MSSQL DBs. Instead of using schemas, they just spin up a new DB. All tables have owner DBO. Is this normal? They don’t use Git. My heart wants to show them so many things:

DataWrangler in VS Code
DuckDB in DBeaver (or Harelquin, Vim-dadbod, the new local Motherduck UI)
Streamlit
pygwalker

Our org is pressing hard for them to adapt to using PBI/Fabric, and I feel they should go a different direction given their needs (speed), ability to upskill (they use SAS, Excel, SSMS, Cognos… they do not use VS Code/any-IDE, Git, Python), and constraints (high workload, limited and fixed staff & $. Public Sector, HighEd.

My boss recommended I show them VS Code Data Wrangler. Which is fine with me…but they are on managed machines, have never installed/used VS Code, but let me know they “think its in their software center”, god knows what that means.

I’m a little worried if I screw this meeting up,  I’ll kill any hope these folks would adapt/evolve, get with the times. There’s queries that take 45 min on their current setup that are sub-second on parquet/DuckDB. And as retarded as Fabric is, it’s also complicated. IMO, more complicated than the awesome FOSS stuff heavily trained by LLMs. I really think DBT would be a game changer too, but nobody at my org uses anything like it. And notebook/one-off development vs. DRY is causing real obstacles.

You guys have any advice? Where are the women DE’s? This is an area I’ve failed far more, and more recent, than I’ve won.

When to use a surrogate key instead of a primary key?,"Hi all!

I am reviewing for interviews and the following question come to mind.

If **surrogate keys** are supposed to be unique identifiers that don't have real world meaning AND if **primary keys** are supposed to reliably identify and distinguish between each individual record (which also don't have real world meaning), then why will someone use a surrogate key? Wouldn't using primary keys be the same? Is there any case in which surrogate keys are the way to go?

P.S: Both surrogate and primary keys are auto generated by DB. Right?

how to deal with azure vm nightmare?,"i am building data pipelines. i use azure vms for experimentation on sample data. when im not using them, i need to shut them off (working at bootstrapped startup).

when restarting my vm, it randomly fails. it says an allocation failure occurred due to capacity in the region (usually us-east). the only solution ive found is moving the resource to a new region, which takes 30–60 mins.

how do i prevent this issue in a cost-effective manner? can azure just allocate my vm to whatever region is available?

When to use a surrogate key instead of a primary key?,"Hi all!

I am reviewing for interviews and the following question come to mind.

If **surrogate keys** are supposed to be unique identifiers that don't have real world meaning AND if **primary keys** are supposed to reliably identify and distinguish between each individual record (which also don't have real world meaning), then why will someone use a surrogate key? Wouldn't using primary keys be the same? Is there any case in which surrogate keys are the way to go?

P.S: Both surrogate and primary keys are auto generated by DB. Right?

P.S.1: I understand that a surrogate key doesn't necessarily have to be the a primary key, so considering that both have no real meaning outside the DB, then I wonder what the purpose of surrogate keys are.

P.S.2: At work (in different projects), we mainly use natural keys for analytical workloads and primary keys for uniquely identifying a given row. So I am wondering on which kind of cases/projects these surrogate keys will fit.

Data Inserts best practices with Iceberg,"I receive various files at different intervals which are not defined. Can be every seconds, hour, daily, etc.

I don’t have any indication also of when something is finished. For example, it’s highly possible to have 100 files that would end up being 100% of my daily table, but I receive them scattered over 15min-30 when the data become available and my ingestion process ingest it. Can be 1 to 12 hours after the day is over.

Not that’s it’s also possible to have 10000 very small files per day.

I’m wondering how is this solves with Iceberg tables. Very newbie Iceberg guy here. Like I don’t see throughput write benchmark anywhere but I figure that rewriting the metadata files must be a big overhead if there’s a very large amount of files so inserting every times there’s a new one must not be the ideal solution.

I’ve read some medium post saying that there was a snapshot feature which track new files so you don’t have to do some fancy things to load them incrementally. But again if every insert is a query that change the metadata files it must be bad at some point.

Data Inserts best practices with Iceberg,"I receive various files at different intervals which are not defined. Can be every seconds, hour, daily, etc.

I don’t have any indication also of when something is finished. For example, it’s highly possible to have 100 files that would end up being 100% of my daily table, but I receive them scattered over 15min-30 when the data become available and my ingestion process ingest it. Can be 1 to 12 hours after the day is over.

Not that’s it’s also possible to have 10000 very small files per day.

I’m wondering how is this solves with Iceberg tables. Very newbie Iceberg guy here. Like I don’t see throughput write benchmark anywhere but I figure that rewriting the metadata files must be a big overhead if there’s a very large amount of files so inserting every times there’s a new one must not be the ideal solution.

I’ve read some medium post saying that there was a snapshot feature which track new files so you don’t have to do some fancy things to load them incrementally. But again if every insert is a query that change the metadata files it must be bad at some point.

Do you wait and usually build a process to store a list of files before inserting them or is this a feature build somewhere already in a doc I can’t find ?

ETL for Ingesting S3 files and converting to Iceberg,"So, I'm currently working on a project (my first) to create a scalable data platform for a company. The whole thing structured around AWS, initially using DMS to migrate PostgreSQL data to S3 in parquet format (this is our raw datalake). Then using Glue jobs to read this data and create Iceberg tables which would be used in Athena queries and Quicksight. I've got a working Glue script for reading this data and perform upsert operations. Okay so now that I've given a bit of context of what I'm trying to do, let me tell you my problem.  
The client wants me to schedule this job to run every 15min or so for staging and most probably every hour for production. The data in the raw datalake is partitioned by date (for example: s3bucket/table\_name/2025/04/10/file.parquet). Now that I have to run this job every 15 min or so I'm not sure how to keep track of the files that have been processed and which haven't. Currently my script finds the current time and modifies the read command to use just the folder for the current date. But still, this means that I'll be reading all the files in the folder (processed already or not) every time the job runs during the day.   
I've looked around and found that using DynamoDB for keeping track of the files would be my best option but also found something related to Iceberg metadata files that could help me with this. I'm leaning towards the Iceberg option as I wanna make use of all its features but have too little information regarding this to implement. would absolutely appreciate it if someone could help me out with this.

How do you handle datetime dimentions ?,"I had a small “argument” at the office today. I am building a fact table to aggregate session metrics from our Google Analytics environment. One of the columns is the of course the session’s datetime. There are multiple reports and dashboards that do analysis at hour granularity. Ex : “What hour are visitors from this source more likely to buy hour product?”

To address this, I creates a date and time dimention. Today, the Data Specialist had an argument with me and said this is suboptimal and a single timestamp dimention should have been created. I though this makes no sense since it would result in extreme redudancy : you would have multiple minute rows for a single day for example.

Serialisation and de-serialisation?,"I just got to know that even in today's OLAP era, but while communicating b/w the systems internally they convert it to row based storage even if the warehouses are columnar type...
This made me sickkk I never knew this at all!

So does this mean serialisation and de-serialisation?? 
I see these terms vary across many architecture ex: In spark they mention these terminologies when the data needs to searched at different instances.. they say data needs to be de-serialised which takes time...

Does anyone feel the DE tools are chaging too fast to track,"TL;DR: a guy feeling stuck in the job and cannot figure out what skills are needed to move to a better position 

I am data engineer at a big 4 firm (may be just a etl developer) in india.

I work with Informatica Power Center, Oracle, Unix on the daily basis. Now, when I tried to switch companies for career boost, I realised nobody uses these tech anymore. 

Everyone uses pyspark for etl.
I though fair enough and started leaning pyspark dataframe api. I am so good with sql, pl/sql and python, so it was easy for me.

Then I came to know learning pyspark is not enough, you need to know databricks, snowflake, dbt kind of tools.

Even before making my mind to decide what to learn, things changed and now airflow/dagster, redshift, delta lake, duckdb. I don't what else is in trend now.

Honestly, It feels a lot, like the world is moving in the fastest pace possible and I cannot even decide what to do.

Every job has different tools, and to do the ""fake it till you make it"", I am afraid they would ask any niche question about the tool to which you can only answer if you have the experience.

My profile  is not even getting picked and I feel stuck in the job I am doing.

I am great at what I do, that is one reason the project is not letting me leave even after all the senior folks has left for better projects. The guy with 3 years of experience is the senior most developer and lead now.

But honestly, I dont think I can make it anymore.

If I was just stuck with something like SAP ABAP, frontend or core python, things might have been good. Recruiters will at least look at your profile even though you are not a perfect match as you can learn the rest to do the job. (I might be wrong in this thought)

But for DE roles, the job descriptions are becoming too specific to a tool and people are expecting complete data architect level of skills at 3 years.

I was so ambitious to get a job in a different country with big 4 experience, but now I can't even get a job in india.",42,32,2025-04-02 09:26:11,0,False,2025-04-02 09:30:54,False,False,2025-04-02 09:26:11,9,Wednesday,382.0,1993,76.45,19,492,9.4,0,0,NEGATIVE,-0.6717807650566101,"['tldr', 'guy', 'feeling', 'stuck', 'job', 'cannot', 'figure', 'skills', 'needed', 'move', 'better', 'position', 'data', 'engineer', 'big', 'firm', 'may', 'etl', 'developer', 'india', 'work', 'informatica', 'power', 'center', 'oracle', 'unix', 'daily', 'basis', 'tried', 'switch', 'companies', 'career', 'boost', 'realised', 'nobody', 'uses', 'tech', 'anymore', 'everyone', 'uses', 'pyspark', 'etl', 'though', 'fair', 'enough', 'started', 'leaning', 'pyspark', 'dataframe', 'api', 'good', 'sql', 'plsql', 'python', 'easy', 'came', 'know', 'learning', 'pyspark', 'enough', 'need', 'know', 'databricks', 'snowflake', 'dbt', 'kind', 'tools', 'even', 'making', 'mind', 'decide', 'learn', 'things', 'changed', 'airflowdagster', 'redshift', 'delta', 'lake', 'duckdb', 'dont', 'else', 'trend', 'honestly', 'feels', 'lot', 'like', 'world', 'moving', 'fastest', 'pace', 'possible', 'cannot', 'even', 'decide', 'every', 'job', 'different', 'tools', 'fake', 'till', 'make', 'afraid', 'would', 'ask', 'niche', 'question', 'tool', 'answer', 'experience', 'profile', 'even', 'getting', 'picked', 'feel', 'stuck', 'job', 'great', 'one', 'reason', 'project', 'letting', 'leave', 'even', 'senior', 'folks', 'left', 'better', 'projects', 'guy', 'years', 'experience', 'senior', 'developer', 'lead', 'honestly', 'dont', 'think', 'make', 'anymore', 'stuck', 'something', 'like', 'sap', 'abap', 'frontend', 'core', 'python', 'things', 'might', 'good', 'recruiters', 'least', 'look', 'profile', 'even', 'though', 'perfect', 'match', 'learn', 'rest', 'job', 'might', 'wrong', 'thought', 'roles', 'job', 'descriptions', 'becoming', 'specific', 'tool', 'people', 'expecting', 'complete', 'data', 'architect', 'level', 'skills', 'years', 'ambitious', 'get', 'job', 'different', 'country', 'big', 'experience', 'cant', 'even', 'get', 'job', 'india']",tldr guy feeling stuck job cannot figure skills needed move better position data engineer big firm may etl developer india work informatica power center oracle unix daily basis tried switch companies career boost realised nobody uses tech anymore everyone uses pyspark etl though fair enough started leaning pyspark dataframe api good sql plsql python easy came know learning pyspark enough need know databricks snowflake dbt kind tools even making mind decide learn things changed airflowdagster redshift delta lake duckdb dont else trend honestly feels lot like world moving fastest pace possible cannot even decide every job different tools fake till make afraid would ask niche question tool answer experience profile even getting picked feel stuck job great one reason project letting leave even senior folks left better projects guy years experience senior developer lead honestly dont think make anymore stuck something like sap abap frontend core python things might good recruiters least look profile even though perfect match learn rest job might wrong thought roles job descriptions becoming specific tool people expecting complete data architect level skills years ambitious get job different country big experience cant even get job india,High,4,4,"know, dont, job, things, really, even, could, good, current, people, question, first, business, feel, sure, still, jobs, found, given, kind, say, take, anything, end, getting, made, free, back, thank, give, practice, please, companies, post, hard, already, field, move, course, someone, got, come, appreciated, wanted, never, theres, didnt, let, may, last, great, ask, thing, isnt, ill, days, always, look, enough, path, small, stuck, understanding, world, long, came, though, seem, noticed, link, honestly, wrong, actual, fast, said, points, month, become, least, figure, due, seen, hoping, week, needed, clear, break, complete, feels, books, forward, finally, book, tell, situation, answer, finance, yes, taking, towards, fear, technology, taken, call, simply, deep, anymore, screening, struggle, rate, theyre, almost, today, fine, seeing, pros, supposed, hand, asking, matter, finding, offers, consistent, oracle, away, interesting, reasons, positions, wonder, cannot, spent, title, generally, colleague, frustrated, analysts, exactly, blah, stats, interviews, knows, decide, procedures, startup, mix, videos, person, guess, encounter, numbers, weeks, took, number, figured, self, shift, covered, sap, links, program, nice, constantly, enjoy, choose, imposter, macbooks, expertise, family, rejected, changed, exams, broke, posts, decisions, guy, tend, sets, mentioned, extremely, answers, regularly, city, fairly, note",8.1,7.9,160.7,-0.685,974.9,56.5,9.0,239.1,10.0,20.1,17.8,82,164,57,"I've built an interactive demo for CDC to help explain how it works.

What's the non-technical biggest barrier you face at work?,"What’s currently challenging for me is getting access to things.

I design a data pipeline, present it to the team that will benefit from it, and everyone gets super excited.

Then I reach out to the internal department or an external party to either grant me admin access to the platform I need, or to help me obtain an API.

A week goes by—nothing. I follow up via email. Eventually, someone replies and says it's not possible to give me admin credentials. Fine. So I ask, “Can you help me get the API instead? It’s very straightforward.”

Another week goes by—still nothing. I send another follow-up…

Now the other person is kind of frustrated (because I’m asking them to do something slightly different, even though I’m offering guidance).

What follows is just a back-and-forth with long, frustrating waiting periods in between. Meanwhile, the team I presented the pipeline or project to starts getting frustrated with me and probably thinks I’m full of crap.

Once I finally get the damn API or whatever access I needed, I complete the project in 1–2 days but delayed by weeks or even months.

as always that's for the insight from other people, I find a lot of these discussions around points very entertaining and very helpful!

I'm having an argument with someone who is several levels above me. This might sound petty so I apologise in advance. It centres around the definition of a Mart. Our Mart is a single Fact with around 20 dimensions. The Fact is extremely wide and deep. Indeed we usually put it into a de normalised table for reporting. To me this isn't a MART as it isn't based on requirements but rather a star schema that supposedly servers multiple purposed or potential purposes. When engaged on requirements the person leans on there experience in the domain and says a user probable wants to do X, Y and Z. I've never seen anything written down. Constantly that report also defers to Kimball methodology and how this follows them closely. My take on the book is that these things need to be based of requirement, business requirements. 

My questions is, is it fair to say that a data mart needs to have requirements and ideally a business domain in mind or else its just a star schema?

Yes this  is  very theoretical... yes I probable need a hobby but look there hasn't been a decent RTS game in years and its friday!!!

Just wanted to share a recent win that made our whole team feel pretty good.,"We worked with this e-commerce client last month (kitchen products company, can't name names) who was dealing with data chaos.

When they came to us, their situation was rough. Dashboards taking forever to load, some poor analyst manually combining data from 5 different sources, and their CEO breathing down everyone's neck for daily conversion reports. Classic spreadsheet hell that we've all seen before.

We spent about two weeks redesigning their entire data architecture. Built them a proper [**data warehouse solution** ](https://datafortune.com/services/enterprise-data-management/data-warehouse/)with automated ETL pipelines that consolidated everything into one central location. Created some logical data models and connected it all to their existing BI tools.

The transformation was honestly pretty incredible to watch. Reports that used to take hours now run in seconds. Their analyst actually took a vacation for the first time in a year. And we got this really nice email from their CTO saying we'd ""changed how they make decisions"" which gave us all the warm fuzzies.

It's projects like these that remind us why we got into this field in the first place. There's something so satisfying about taking a messy data situation and turning it into something clean and efficient that actually helps people do their jobs better.",0,9,2025-04-04 14:20:44,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-04 14:20:44,14,Friday,203.0,1339,56.76,14,330,11.9,1,0,NEGATIVE,-0.9992449283599854,"['worked', 'ecommerce', 'client', 'last', 'month', 'kitchen', 'products', 'company', 'cant', 'name', 'names', 'dealing', 'data', 'chaos', 'came', 'situation', 'rough', 'dashboards', 'taking', 'forever', 'load', 'poor', 'analyst', 'manually', 'combining', 'data', 'different', 'sources', 'ceo', 'breathing', 'everyones', 'neck', 'daily', 'conversion', 'reports', 'classic', 'spreadsheet', 'hell', 'weve', 'seen', 'spent', 'two', 'weeks', 'redesigning', 'entire', 'data', 'architecture', 'built', 'proper', 'data', 'warehouse', 'solution', 'httpsdatafortunecomservicesenterprisedatamanagementdatawarehousewith', 'automated', 'etl', 'pipelines', 'consolidated', 'everything', 'one', 'central', 'location', 'created', 'logical', 'data', 'models', 'connected', 'existing', 'tools', 'transformation', 'honestly', 'pretty', 'incredible', 'watch', 'reports', 'used', 'take', 'hours', 'run', 'seconds', 'analyst', 'actually', 'took', 'vacation', 'first', 'time', 'year', 'got', 'really', 'nice', 'email', 'cto', 'saying', 'wed', 'changed', 'make', 'decisions', 'gave', 'warm', 'fuzzies', 'projects', 'like', 'remind', 'got', 'field', 'first', 'place', 'theres', 'something', 'satisfying', 'taking', 'messy', 'data', 'situation', 'turning', 'something', 'clean', 'efficient', 'actually', 'helps', 'people', 'jobs', 'better']",worked ecommerce client last month kitchen products company cant name names dealing data chaos came situation rough dashboards taking forever load poor analyst manually combining data different sources ceo breathing everyones neck daily conversion reports classic spreadsheet hell weve seen spent two weeks redesigning entire data architecture built proper data warehouse solution httpsdatafortunecomservicesenterprisedatamanagementdatawarehousewith automated etl pipelines consolidated everything one central location created logical data models connected existing tools transformation honestly pretty incredible watch reports used take hours run seconds analyst actually took vacation first time year got really nice email cto saying wed changed make decisions gave warm fuzzies projects like remind got field first place theres something satisfying taking messy data situation turning something clean efficient actually helps people jobs better,Low,4,4,"know, dont, job, things, really, even, could, good, current, people, question, first, business, feel, sure, still, jobs, found, given, kind, say, take, anything, end, getting, made, free, back, thank, give, practice, please, companies, post, hard, already, field, move, course, someone, got, come, appreciated, wanted, never, theres, didnt, let, may, last, great, ask, thing, isnt, ill, days, always, look, enough, path, small, stuck, understanding, world, long, came, though, seem, noticed, link, honestly, wrong, actual, fast, said, points, month, become, least, figure, due, seen, hoping, week, needed, clear, break, complete, feels, books, forward, finally, book, tell, situation, answer, finance, yes, taking, towards, fear, technology, taken, call, simply, deep, anymore, screening, struggle, rate, theyre, almost, today, fine, seeing, pros, supposed, hand, asking, matter, finding, offers, consistent, oracle, away, interesting, reasons, positions, wonder, cannot, spent, title, generally, colleague, frustrated, analysts, exactly, blah, stats, interviews, knows, decide, procedures, startup, mix, videos, person, guess, encounter, numbers, weeks, took, number, figured, self, shift, covered, sap, links, program, nice, constantly, enjoy, choose, imposter, macbooks, expertise, family, rejected, changed, exams, broke, posts, decisions, guy, tend, sets, mentioned, extremely, answers, regularly, city, fairly, note",8.1,7.9,160.7,-0.685,974.9,56.5,9.0,239.1,10.0,20.1,17.8,82,164,57,"I've built an interactive demo for CDC to help explain how it works.

Jira: Is it still helping teams... or just slowing them down?,"I’ve been part of (and led) a teams over the last decade — in enterprises

And one tool keeps showing up everywhere: **Jira**.

It’s the ""default"" for a lot of engineering orgs. Everyone knows it. Everyone uses it.  
But **I don’t seen anyone who actually likes it.**

Not in the *""ugh it's corporate but fine""* way — I mean people who are actively frustrated by it but still use it daily.

Here are some of the most common friction points I’ve either experienced or heard from other devs/product folks:

1. **Custom workflows spiral out of control** — What starts as ""just a few tweaks"" becomes an unmanageable mess.
2. **Slow performance** — Large projects? Boards crawling? Yup.
3. **Search that requires sorcery** — Good luck finding an old ticket without a detailed Jira PhD.
4. **New team members struggle to onboard** — It’s not exactly intuitive.
5. **The “tool tax”** — Teams spend hours updating Jira instead of moving work forward.

And yet... most teams stick with it. Because switching is painful. Because “at least everyone knows Jira.” Because the alternative is more uncertainty.

Dilemma: SWE vs DE @ Big Tech,"I currently work at a Big Tech and have 3 YoE. My role is a mix of Full-Stack + Data Engineering. 

I want to keep preparing for interviews on the side, and to do that I need to know which role to aim for. 

Pros of SWE:
- more jobs positions 
- I have already invested 300 hours into DSA Leetcode. Don’t have to start DE prep from scratch
-Maybe better quality of work/pay(?)

Pros of DE:
- targeting a niche has always given me more callbacks
- if I practice a lot of sql, the interviews at FAANG could be gamed. FAANG do ask DSA but they barely scratch the surface

My thoughts:
Ideally I want to crack the SWE role at a FAANG as I like both roles equally but SWE pays 20% more. If I don’t get callbacks for SWE, then securing a similar pay through a DE role at FAANG is lucrative too. 
I’d be completely fine with doing DE, but I feel uneasy wasting the 100s of hours I spent on DSA.

The 6 companies where the following:

|Company|Role|Interviews|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Meta|Data Engineer|HR and then LC tech screening. Rejected after screening|
|Amazon|Data Engineer 1|Take home tech screening then LC type tech screening. Rejected after second screening|
|Root|Senior Data Engineer|HR then HM. Got rejected after HM|
|Kin|Senior Data Engineer|Only HR, got rejected after.|
|Clipboard Health|Data Engineer|Online take home screening, fairly easy but got rejected after.|
|Disney Streaming|Senior Data Engineer|Passed HR and HM interviews. Declined technical screening loop.|

At the end of the day, my current company offered me a good package to stay as well as a team change to a more architecture type role.

My Experience in preparing Azure Data Engineer Associate DP-203.,"So I recently appeared for the DP-203 certification by Microsoft and want to share my learnings and strategy that I followed to crack the exam.

As you all must already be knowing that this exam is labelled as “**Intermediate**” by Microsoft themselves which is perfect in my opinion. This exam does test you in the various concepts that are required for a data engineer to  master in his/her career. 

Having said that, it is not too hard to crack the exam but at the same time also not as easy as appearing for AZ-900. 

DP-203 is aimed at testing the understanding of data related concepts and various tools Microsoft has offered in its suite to make your life easier. Some topics include SQL, Modern Data Warehousing, Python, PySpark, Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure EventHubs, Azure Data Lake Storage and last but not the least Azure Databricks. You can go through the complete set of topics this exam focuses on here - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer/?practice-assessment-type=certification#certification-take-the-exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer/?practice-assessment-type=certification#certification-take-the-exam)



**Courses:**

I had just taken this one course for DP-203 by Alan Rodrigues *(This is not a paid promotion. I just thought that these resources were good to refer to)* and this is a 24 hour long course which has covered all the important and core concepts clearly and precisely. What I loved the most about this course is that it is a complete hands-on course. One more thing is that the instructor very rarely mentions anything as “this has already been covered in the previous sections”. If there is anything that we are using in the current section he makes sure to give a quick background on what has been covered in the earlier sections. Why this is so important is because we tend to forget some things and by just getting a refresher in a couple of sentences we are up to speed. 

For those of you who don’t know, Microsoft offers access to majority resources if not all for FREE credit worth $200 for 30 days. So you simply have to sign up on their portal (insert link) and get access to all of them for 30 days. If you are residing in another country then convert dollars to your local currency. That is how much worth of free credit you will get for 30 days. 

**For example -** 

I live in India. 

1 $ = 87.789 INR 

So I got FREE credits worth 87.789 X 200 = Rs 17,557

Even when I appeared for the exam (Feb 8th, 2025) I hardly got 3-4 questions from the mock tests. But don’t get disheartened. Be sure you are consistent with your learning path and take notes whenever required. As I mentioned earlier, the exam is not very hard.

**Mock Tests Resources:**

So I had referred a couple of resources for taking the mocks which I have mentioned below. *(This is not a paid promotion. I just thought that these resources were good to refer to.)*



1. **Udemy Practice Tests -** [https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-microsoft-azure-dp-203-data-engineering/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING](https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-microsoft-azure-dp-203-data-engineering/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING)
2. **Microsoft Practice Assessments -** [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=49&practice-assessment-type=certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=49&practice-assessment-type=certification)
3. [https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/dp-203/](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/dp-203/)





**DO’s:**



1. Make sure that if and whenever possible you do hands-on for all the sections and videos that have been covered in the Udemy course as I am 100% sure that you will encounter certain errors and would have to explore and solve the errors by yourself. This will build a sense of confidence and achievement after being able to run the pipelines or code all by yourself. (Also don’t forget to delete or pause resources whenever needed so that you get a hang of it and don’t lose out on money. The instructor does tell you when to do so.)
2. Let’s be very practical, nobody remembers all the resolutions or solutions to every single issue or problem faced in the past. We tend to forget things over time and hence it is very important to document everything that you think is useful and would be important in the future. Maintain an excel sheet and create two columns “**Errors” and “Learnings/Resolution**” so that next time you encounter the same issue you already have a solution and don’t waste time. 
3. Watch and practice at least 5-10 videos daily. This way you can complete all the videos in a month and then go back and rewatch lessons you thought were hard. Then you can start giving practice tests. 





**DON'Ts:**



1. By heart all the MCQs or answers to the questions. 
2. Refer to many resources so much so that you will get overwhelmed and not be able to focus on preparation.
3. Even refer to multiple courses from different websites.





**Conclusion:**

All in all, just make sure you do your hands on, practice regularly, give a timeline for yourself, don’t mug up things, don’t by heart things, make sure you use limited but quality resources for learning and practice. I am sure that by following these things you will be able to crack the exam in the first attempt itself.

GCP Professional Data Engineer,"Hey guys,

I would like to hear your thoughts or suggestions on something I’m struggling with. I’m currently preparing for the Google Cloud Data Engineer certification, and I’ve been going through the official study materials on Google Cloud SkillBoost. Unfortunately, I’ve found the experience really disappointing.

The ""Data Engineer Learning Path"" feels overly basic and repetitive, especially if you already have some experience in the field. Up to Unit 6, they at least provide PDFs, which I could skim through. But starting from Unit 7, the content switches almost entirely to videos — and they’re long, slow-paced, and not very engaging. Worse still, they don’t go deep enough into the topics to give me confidence for the exam.

Transitioning from DE to ML Engineer in 2025?,"I am a DE with 2 years of experience, but my background is mainly in statistics. I have been offered a position as an ML Engineer (de facto Data Scientist, but also working on deployment - it is a smaller IT department, so my scope of duties will be simply quite wide). 

The position is interesting, and there are multiple pros and cons to it (that I do not want to discuss in this post). However my question is a bit more general - in 2025, with all the LLMs performing quite well with code generation and fixing, which path would you say is more stable long-term - sticking to DE and becoming better and better at it, or moving more towards ML and doing data science projects?

Furthermore, I also wonder about growth in each field - in ML/DS, my fear is that I am not PhD nor excellent mathematician. In DE, on the other hand, my fear is lack of my solid CS/SWE foundations (as my background is more in statistics). 

Ultimately, it is just an honest question, as I am very curious of your perspective on the matter - does moving towards data science projects (XGBoost and other algorithms) in 2025 from DE (PySpark and Airflow) makes sense in 2025? Which path would you say is more reasonable, and what kind of growth I can expect for each position? Personally I am a bit reluctant to switch simply since I have already dedicated 2 years to growing as an DE, but on the other hand I also see how much more and more of my tasks can be automated.

"Struggling with Career Path – Stuck in Java, Want to Return to Data Engineering (6.5 YOE)","I've been working in IT for the past 6.5 years. I started as a Java Developer for a year before transitioning into Data Engineering, where I worked with Airflow, GCP, Python, and SQL (BigQuery).

In June 2022, I joined my second company as a Data Engineer, but after just six months, the project was shelved, and I was moved to a Java-based project (Spring Boot, Kafka, etc.). This happened during a market downturn and layoffs, so I was grateful to still have a job.

Now, after two years in this role, I feel stuck. I struggle with coding, don’t enjoy Java, and constantly feel like an imposter. I know for sure that I don’t want to continue in Java and Spring Boot. However, I’ve stayed in this role because it’s high-paying, and I have family responsibilities (supporting a family of five).

I want to transition back into Data Engineering, but now the job market expects a higher level of expertise given my experience and salary range. I’m unsure about the best way to upskill and make this switch without a major setback.

How can I strategically transition back into Data Engineering while balancing financial stability? Would love advice from those who have made similar career shifts.

Passed DP-203 -- some thoughts on its retiring,"i took the Azure DP-203 last week — of course, it’s retiring literally tomorrow. But I figured it is indeed a very broad certification and so it can give a ""grounding"" scope in Azure D.E.

Also, I think it's still super early to go full Fabric (DP-600 or even DP-700), because the job demand is still not really there. Most jobs still demand strong grounding in Azure services even in the wake of Fabric adoption (POCing…).

So of course here, it’s retiring literally tomorrow unfortunately. I have passed the exam with a high score (900+). Also, I have worked (during internship) directly with MS Fabric only. So I would say some skills actually transfer quite nicely (ex: ADF ~ FDF).

---

### Some notes on resources for future exams:

I have relied primarily on [@tybulonazure](https://www.youtube.com/@tybulonazure)’s excellent YouTube channel (DP-203 playlist). It’s really great (watch on 1.8x – 2x speed).  
Now going back to Fabric, I have seen he has pivoted to Fabric-centric content — also a great news!

I also used the official “Guide” book (2024 version), which I found to be a surprisingly good way of structuring your learning. I hope equivalents for Fabric will be similar (TBS…).

---

The labs on Microsoft Learn are honestly **poorly designed** for what they offer.  
**Tip:** @tybul has video labs too — *use these*.  
And for the exams, always focus on **conceptual understanding**, not rote memorization.

Another **important (and mostly ignored)** tip:  
Focus on the **“best practices”** sections of Azure services in Microsoft Learn — I’ve read a lot of MS documentation, and those parts are often more helpful on the exam than the main pages.

---

**Examtopics** is obviously very helpful — but **read the comments**, they’re essential!

---

Finally, I do think it’s a shame it’s retiring — because the “traditional” Azure environment knowledge seems to be a sort of industry standard for companies. Also, the Fabric pricing model seems quite aggressive.

So for juniors, it would have been really good to still be able to have this background knowledge as a base layer.",16,2,2025-03-30 19:48:14,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-30

What is expected of me as a Junior Data Engineer in 2025?,"Hello all, 

I've been interviewing for a proper Junior Data Engineer position and have been doing well in the rounds so far. I've done my recruiter call, HR call and coding assessment. Waiting on the 4th.

I want to be great. I am willing to learn from those of you who are more experienced than me.  
  
Can anyone share examples from their own careers on attitude, communication, soft skills, time management, charisma, willingness to learn and other soft skills that I should keep in mind. Or maybe what I should not do instead.

How should I approach the technical side? There are 1000's of technologies to learn. So I have been learning basics with soft skills and hoping everything works out.

3 years ago I had a labour job and did well in that too. So this grind has caused me to rewire my brain to work in tech and corporate work. I am aiming for 20 years more in this field.

Any insights are appreciated.

Transitioning from DE to ML Engineer in 2025?,"I am a DE with 2 years of experience, but my background is mainly in statistics. I have been offered a position as an ML Engineer (de facto Data Scientist, but also working on deployment - it is a smaller IT department, so my scope of duties will be simply quite wide). 

The position is interesting, and there are multiple pros and cons to it (that I do not want to discuss in this post). However my question is a bit more general - in 2025, with all the LLMs performing quite well with code generation and fixing, which path would you say is more stable long-term - sticking to DE and becoming better and better at it, or moving more towards ML and doing data science projects?

Furthermore, I also wonder about growth in each field - in ML/DS, my fear is that I am not PhD nor excellent mathematician. In DE, on the other hand, my fear is lack of my solid CS/SWE foundations (as my background is more in statistics). 

Ultimately, it is just an honest question, as I am very curious of your perspective on the matter - does moving towards data science projects (XGBoost and other algorithms) in 2025 from DE (PySpark and Airflow) makes sense in 2025? Which path would you say is more reasonable, and what kind of growth I can expect for each position? Personally I am a bit reluctant to switch simply since I have already dedicated 2 years to growing as an DE, but on the other hand I also see how much more and more of my tasks can be automated.

"Struggling with Career Path – Stuck in Java, Want to Return to Data Engineering (6.5 YOE)","I've been working in IT for the past 6.5 years. I started as a Java Developer for a year before transitioning into Data Engineering, where I worked with Airflow, GCP, Python, and SQL (BigQuery).

In June 2022, I joined my second company as a Data Engineer, but after just six months, the project was shelved, and I was moved to a Java-based project (Spring Boot, Kafka, etc.). This happened during a market downturn and layoffs, so I was grateful to still have a job.

Now, after two years in this role, I feel stuck. I struggle with coding, don’t enjoy Java, and constantly feel like an imposter. I know for sure that I don’t want to continue in Java and Spring Boot. However, I’ve stayed in this role because it’s high-paying, and I have family responsibilities (supporting a family of five).

I want to transition back into Data Engineering, but now the job market expects a higher level of expertise given my experience and salary range. I’m unsure about the best way to upskill and make this switch without a major setback.

How can I strategically transition back into Data Engineering while balancing financial stability? Would love advice from those who have made similar career shifts.

Seeking Advice from DE: Taking a Career Break to Work & Travel in Australia,"Hey DE,

I’d love to get your perspective on my situation.

# My Background

I’m a Brazilian Mechanical Engineer with 3 years of experience in the Data field—started as a Data Analyst for 1.5 years, then transitioned into Data Engineering. Next week, I’ll be starting as a Data Architect at a multinational with 100,000+ employees, mainly working with the Azure stack.

# The Plan

My girlfriend and I are planning to move to Australia for about a year to travel and build memories together before settling down (marriage, house, etc.). This new job came unexpectedly, but it offers a good salary (\~$2,000 USD/month).

The idea is to:

* Move to Australia
* Work hard & save around $1,000 USD/month
* Travel as much as possible for \~2 years
* Return and re-enter the data field

# The Challenge

The work visa limitation allows me to stay only 6 months with the same employer, making it tough to get good Data Engineering jobs. So, I plan to work in any job that pays well (fruit picking, hospitality, etc.), and my girlfriend will do the same.

# The Concern

When I return, how hard will it be to get back into the data field after a \~2-year break?

* I’ll have enough savings to stay unemployed for about a year if needed.
* This isn’t all my savings—I have the equivalent of 6 years of salary in reserve.
* I regularly get recruiter messages on LinkedIn.
* I speak Portuguese, English, and Spanish fluently.

Given your experience, how risky is this career break? is totally crazy ? Would you recommend a different approach? Any advice would be appreciated!",0,2,2025-03-31 14:34:32,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-31 14:34:32,14,Monday,276.0,1564,65.12,18,388,10.6,0,0,POSITIVE,0.933197557926178,"['hey', 'love', 'get', 'perspective', 'situation', 'background', 'brazilian', 'mechanical', 'engineer', 'years', 'experience', 'data', 'fieldstarted', 'data', 'analyst', 'years', 'transitioned', 'data', 'engineering', 'next', 'week', 'ill', 'starting', 'data', 'architect', 'multinational', 'employees', 'mainly', 'working', 'azure', 'stack', 'plan', 'girlfriend', 'planning', 'move', 'australia', 'year', 'travel', 'build', 'memories', 'together', 'settling', 'marriage', 'house', 'etc', 'new', 'job', 'came', 'unexpectedly', 'offers', 'good', 'salary', 'usdmonth', 'idea', 'move', 'australia', 'work', 'hard', 'save', 'around', 'usdmonth', 'travel', 'much', 'possible', 'years', 'return', 'reenter', 'data', 'field', 'challenge', 'work', 'visa', 'limitation', 'allows', 'stay', 'months', 'employer', 'making', 'tough', 'get', 'good', 'data', 'engineering', 'jobs', 'plan', 'work', 'job', 'pays', 'well', 'fruit', 'picking', 'hospitality', 'etc', 'girlfriend', 'concern', 'return', 'hard', 'get', 'back', 'data', 'field', 'year', 'break', 'ill', 'enough', 'savings', 'stay', 'unemployed', 'year', 'needed', 'isnt', 'savingsi', 'equivalent', 'years', 'salary', 'reserve', 'regularly', 'get', 'recruiter', 'messages', 'linkedin', 'speak', 'portuguese', 'english', 'spanish', 'fluently', 'given', 'experience', 'risky', 'career', 'break', 'totally', 'crazy', 'would', 'recommend', 'different', 'approach', 'advice', 'would', 'appreciated']",hey love get perspective situation background brazilian mechanical engineer years experience data fieldstarted data analyst years transitioned data engineering next week ill starting data architect multinational employees mainly working azure stack plan girlfriend planning move australia year travel build memories together settling marriage house etc new job came unexpectedly offers good salary usdmonth idea move australia work hard save around usdmonth travel much possible years return reenter data field challenge work visa limitation allows stay months employer making tough get good data engineering jobs plan work job pays well fruit picking hospitality etc girlfriend concern return hard get back data field year break ill enough savings stay unemployed year needed isnt savingsi equivalent years salary reserve regularly get recruiter messages linkedin speak portuguese english spanish fluently given experience risky career break totally crazy would recommend different approach advice would appreciated,Low,5,5,"work, ive, engineering, working, experience, engineer, company, years, much, well, thanks, role, everyone, anyone, learning, projects, year, software, learn, advice, appreciate, engineers, suggestions, skills, actually, going, quite, worked, career, advance, bit, recently, started, starting, analyst, technical, hello, months, tech, ago, stack, share, position, roles, guys, pretty, far, mainly, later, fabric, folks, helpful, microsoft, department, curious, recommendations, together, level, knowledge, background, science, exam, previous, research, basic, solid, practices, industry, mostly, offer, coding, general, employees, developer, switch, less, growth, senior, handson, courses, experiences, scratch, moved, spend, transition, higher, major, infra, lead, dagster, yrs, java, longterm, becoming, growing, offered, perspective, certification, grow, stay, managed, feeling, programming, reason, leave, scientist, market, school, scope, opportunity, theoretical, switching, term, decent, opinion, obviously, three, basics, comfortable, involved, junior, strong, majority, financial, salary, overall, half, honest, transitioning, gap, strategy, consulting, told, lol, poor, swe, ecommerce, accepted, space, discussions, devops, hadoop, dba, mention, felt, demand, watch, sections, joined, docs, head, deal, grasp, lack, reasonable, stable, planning, fixing, llms, statistics, assigned, contract, sub, left, manager, previously, gain",8.1,7.5,161.9,-0.696,985.4,56.5,9.1,241.5,10.2,20.5,17.4,75,165,58,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

"Lucked into a junior data engineer role, where do I go from here?","
About a month ago I was hired at a very small startup (3 employees including me) to be their ""data engineer and analyst"", replacing the previous data engineer who moved on to a grad scheme.

I recently graduated in a non-CS discipline, so my Python and SQL skills aren't exactly amazing but I'm a fast learner. It helps that the other employees are non-technical and the previous data engineer was extremely helpful while training me.

The job has been going well so far. I can see myself getting my skills up to a good standard, and it's a great role to learn the ropes BUT I can't see myself in this role for longer than a year or two. So what should I prepare for next? A more demanding data engineer job? Further education?

I'd like to have a technical job in the financial sector within the next 5-6 years e.g. data engineer for a quant firm.

DBA to Data Engineer,"Hi Everyone,
I have been working as an Oracle DBA for a while now, but I am not enjoying what am I doing. A year ago, I got interested in data engineering and tried to self-learn while juggling a full-time job, GRE prep(planning to go for masters as it’s always been my dream), and everything else… safe to say, it wasn’t easy. Since my job didn’t really involve coding and I ended up with mostly theoretical knowledge. I do know Python, Azure(again theoretical knowledge) and SQL (thanks to work), but I still have a long way to go in data engineering. Now that I’m finally taking this step, I am thinking to quit my current job and put all my efforts solely on switching from DBA to data engineering.

Is my career choice taking me away from Data engineering jobs ?,"Hello everyone,

First of all English is not my first language so I apologize if there are mistakes or if everything is not clear.

I've been working for 6 years and my career path is not very consistent.  
I started in non-technical positions for 3 years and then moved on to a more technical one. 

For 3 years I had a very diversified job with software development (Php, Python), database management, Linux system administration, a bit of Cloud and a big part of “Data” with ETL flows (Talend) and a lot of SQL. The project was quite large and the team very small, so I was working on several tasks at once.

I really enjoyed the Data part and I got it into my head that I wanted to be a 'real' Data Engineer and not just drag and drop on Talend.

I was just starting my research when a friend of mine contacted me because a software engineer position was opening up in his company. I went through the recruitment process and accepted their proposal.

  
As in my previous position, I'll be working on a lot of things (mobile development, backend, a bit of frontend, cloud, devops) and the salary offered was 20% higher than what I had in my previous job. (I'm now at 48k€ and I don't live in a big city).  
The offer was really attractive and as the market is a bit complicated at the moment, I accepted.

But I'm wondering if this choice will take me even further away from the Data Engineer job i wanted.

Do you find my career path coherent?  
Could I switch back to Data in a few years' time?

Thank you for reading me !",0,16,2025-04-02 07:34:18,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-02 07:34:18,7,Wednesday,286.0,1528,69.11,15,398,11.5,0,0,NEGATIVE,-0.9992550015449524,"['hello', 'everyone', 'first', 'english', 'first', 'language', 'apologize', 'mistakes', 'everything', 'clear', 'ive', 'working', 'years', 'career', 'path', 'consistent', 'started', 'nontechnical', 'positions', 'years', 'moved', 'technical', 'one', 'years', 'diversified', 'job', 'software', 'development', 'php', 'python', 'database', 'management', 'linux', 'system', 'administration', 'bit', 'cloud', 'big', 'part', 'data', 'etl', 'flows', 'talend', 'lot', 'sql', 'project', 'quite', 'large', 'team', 'small', 'working', 'several', 'tasks', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'data', 'part', 'got', 'head', 'wanted', 'real', 'data', 'engineer', 'drag', 'drop', 'talend', 'starting', 'research', 'friend', 'mine', 'contacted', 'software', 'engineer', 'position', 'opening', 'company', 'went', 'recruitment', 'process', 'accepted', 'proposal', 'previous', 'position', 'ill', 'working', 'lot', 'things', 'mobile', 'development', 'backend', 'bit', 'frontend', 'cloud', 'devops', 'salary', 'offered', 'higher', 'previous', 'job', 'dont', 'live', 'big', 'city', 'offer', 'really', 'attractive', 'market', 'bit', 'complicated', 'moment', 'accepted', 'wondering', 'choice', 'take', 'even', 'away', 'data', 'engineer', 'job', 'wanted', 'find', 'career', 'path', 'coherent', 'could', 'switch', 'back', 'data', 'years', 'time', 'thank', 'reading']",hello everyone first english first language apologize mistakes everything clear ive working years career path consistent started nontechnical positions years moved technical one years diversified job software development php python database management linux system administration bit cloud big part data etl flows talend lot sql project quite large team small working several tasks really enjoyed data part got head wanted real data engineer drag drop talend starting research friend mine contacted software engineer position opening company went recruitment process accepted proposal previous position ill working lot things mobile development backend bit frontend cloud devops salary offered higher previous job dont live big city offer really attractive market bit complicated moment accepted wondering choice take even away data engineer job wanted find career path coherent could switch back data years time thank reading,Low,5,5,"work, ive, engineering, working, experience, engineer, company, years, much, well, thanks, role, everyone, anyone, learning, projects, year, software, learn, advice, appreciate, engineers, suggestions, skills, actually, going, quite, worked, career, advance, bit, recently, started, starting, analyst, technical, hello, months, tech, ago, stack, share, position, roles, guys, pretty, far, mainly, later, fabric, folks, helpful, microsoft, department, curious, recommendations, together, level, knowledge, background, science, exam, previous, research, basic, solid, practices, industry, mostly, offer, coding, general, employees, developer, switch, less, growth, senior, handson, courses, experiences, scratch, moved, spend, transition, higher, major, infra, lead, dagster, yrs, java, longterm, becoming, growing, offered, perspective, certification, grow, stay, managed, feeling, programming, reason, leave, scientist, market, school, scope, opportunity, theoretical, switching, term, decent, opinion, obviously, three, basics, comfortable, involved, junior, strong, majority, financial, salary, overall, half, honest, transitioning, gap, strategy, consulting, told, lol, poor, swe, ecommerce, accepted, space, discussions, devops, hadoop, dba, mention, felt, demand, watch, sections, joined, docs, head, deal, grasp, lack, reasonable, stable, planning, fixing, llms, statistics, assigned, contract, sub, left, manager, previously, gain",8.1,7.5,161.9,-0.696,985.4,56.5,9.1,241.5,10.2,20.5,17.4,75,165,58,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

How AI will dramatically change DE,"After some struggle with a pipeline today, Gemini 2.5 one-shotted the solution. It's superior in most software problems compared to humans (check coders eval) and we're just two and a half years in.

The capabilities are mind-bending. Data engineering as we know it will change drastically with new AI tooling and self-adjusting infrastructure.

We know this profession will evolve drastically. What do you think where things are heading and how to hedge against AI? Become more social / human I guess 😂

A few hypotheses:
- pipelines and infra manages itself with much higher accuracy and less misconfigurations
- the data engineer profile will shift, they become subject matter experts, they must understand the business and do product management
- technical skills do not matter since the gap from idiot to genius is much smaller than from genius to agi/asi",0,8,2025-04-02 20:34:45,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-02 20:34:45,20,Wednesday,140.0,860,54.32,8,216,11.7,0,0,POSITIVE,0.9916075468063354,"['struggle', 'pipeline', 'today', 'gemini', 'oneshotted', 'solution', 'superior', 'software', 'problems', 'compared', 'humans', 'check', 'coders', 'eval', 'two', 'half', 'years', 'capabilities', 'mindbending', 'data', 'engineering', 'know', 'change', 'drastically', 'new', 'tooling', 'selfadjusting', 'infrastructure', 'know', 'profession', 'evolve', 'drastically', 'think', 'things', 'heading', 'hedge', 'become', 'social', 'human', 'guess', 'hypotheses', 'pipelines', 'infra', 'manages', 'much', 'higher', 'accuracy', 'less', 'misconfigurations', 'data', 'engineer', 'profile', 'shift', 'become', 'subject', 'matter', 'experts', 'must', 'understand', 'business', 'product', 'management', 'technical', 'skills', 'matter', 'since', 'gap', 'idiot', 'genius', 'much', 'smaller', 'genius', 'agiasi']",struggle pipeline today gemini oneshotted solution superior software problems compared humans check coders eval two half years capabilities mindbending data engineering know change drastically new tooling selfadjusting infrastructure know profession evolve drastically think things heading hedge become social human guess hypotheses pipelines infra manages much higher accuracy less misconfigurations data engineer profile shift become subject matter experts must understand business product management technical skills matter since gap idiot genius much smaller genius agiasi,Low,5,5,"work, ive, engineering, working, experience, engineer, company, years, much, well, thanks, role, everyone, anyone, learning, projects, year, software, learn, advice, appreciate, engineers, suggestions, skills, actually, going, quite, worked, career, advance, bit, recently, started, starting, analyst, technical, hello, months, tech, ago, stack, share, position, roles, guys, pretty, far, mainly, later, fabric, folks, helpful, microsoft, department, curious, recommendations, together, level, knowledge, background, science, exam, previous, research, basic, solid, practices, industry, mostly, offer, coding, general, employees, developer, switch, less, growth, senior, handson, courses, experiences, scratch, moved, spend, transition, higher, major, infra, lead, dagster, yrs, java, longterm, becoming, growing, offered, perspective, certification, grow, stay, managed, feeling, programming, reason, leave, scientist, market, school, scope, opportunity, theoretical, switching, term, decent, opinion, obviously, three, basics, comfortable, involved, junior, strong, majority, financial, salary, overall, half, honest, transitioning, gap, strategy, consulting, told, lol, poor, swe, ecommerce, accepted, space, discussions, devops, hadoop, dba, mention, felt, demand, watch, sections, joined, docs, head, deal, grasp, lack, reasonable, stable, planning, fixing, llms, statistics, assigned, contract, sub, left, manager, previously, gain",8.1,7.5,161.9,-0.696,985.4,56.5,9.1,241.5,10.2,20.5,17.4,75,165,58,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

Struggling to resolve tickets - DE Course Recommendations?,"I’m looking for recommendations for a solid online course to learn Data Engineering. Less than a year ago, I started a new role as a BI developer. Most of my work involves creating data models and reports in Power BI using T-SQL and DAX, but lately I’ve been tasked with handling tickets related to reports showing incorrect data on the ETL side.

We use Wherescape for our ETL processes, but I’ve struggled to find good learning material for this tool. There's no formal training and everyone learns on the job. There’s so much to analyze during investigations, especially when reverse-engineering the problem.

I’m a visual learner, so I’d love recommendations for courses with videos and hands-on practice. Any suggestions? Thanks!

My company adopted a stateful REST API solution I built that's run locally on every machine. I would like to deploy it to the cloud but I am not sure that's smart. Thoughts?,"**Context:** I joined a finance consultancy a few years ago and noticed that most people in my department are frustrated with the current ""software"" our engineering team has built over decades (yes - not years, decades). The issue is that the software consists of a bundle of Python scripts that repeatedly read large CSV files whenever a user interacts with it. The master CSV file ranges in size from 20MB to 1GB.

For example, if a user wants to select an option from a dropdown menu, clicking the dropdown triggers the reading and aggregation of a 1GB file, after which the frontend is ""returned"" 20 strings (the dropdown options). By ""returned,"" I mean that a new CSV file is created somewhere on the user's local file system, and the ""frontend"" picks it up. I tested a similar functionality using a Flask REST API, and once the CSV file is loaded into virtual memory, the process takes only 100ms—compared to the current design, which takes a full minute (some of it is due to scripts needing to sort out dependencies, validation, etc.). However, our engineering team refuses to adopt web-based communication, arguing that it's not worth the effort. The idea of using a cloud-based relational database is essentially taboo; it has to be either CSV files or Python’s pickle dumps on each user's local system.

I have some experience in software engineering, so I made it my mission to redesign this legacy monster—with the blessing of a senior manager. So far, the transition has gone incredibly well. Last year, I did a soft launch of a small subset of features, and within days, every person in my department was using it.

**Question:** My current design requires users to set up a virtual environment and run an installation script that sorts out any environment variables, dependencies, etc. Each time they want to start the software, they must run a local Flask API, which interacts with a React TypeScript frontend. When the Flask API starts, it loads all necessary files into memory, does validation and other things (takes around a minute). After that, every subsequent request is easy and takes on average 100 to 200 ms. However, I dislike that each user needs a fully configured environment. Version control is also a headache since every user must manually run an update script.

I’d like to move my Flask API to the cloud so that either:

1. **A single server serves all colleagues**, or
2. **Each colleague gets a dedicated node/pod.**

The problem with a single server is that it would quickly run out of virtual memory if 100+ colleagues loaded large datasets simultaneously. The problem with one node per colleague is the complexity—it would require Kubernetes (K8s) or AWS Fargate, along with an orchestrator to manage node creation and termination, which is a significant engineering effort.

I then considered making my Flask API stateless: storing large datasets in S3, using DynamoDB for file mapping, and loading data into virtual memory on every request. I converted some sample datasets to Parquet, reducing their size significantly (down to \~10MB), but I worry about added latency. Repeatedly reading the same data (given that each user makes 1–10 requests per minute) seems highly inefficient.

Am I missing any alternatives? Based on this, a local Flask API still seems like the best option—unless I want to pay for an expensive 64GB vRAM EC2 instance or invest significant time in building a node-per-user architecture.

What is the best approach for a Bronze layer?,"Hello,

\- Our bronze layer are those files in the HDFS?  
\- For build our bronze layer, we need to load those files incrementally into a ""bronze table"" partitioned by date

Built a visual tool on top of Pandas that runs Python transformations row-by-row - What do you guys think?,"Hey data engineers,

For client implementations I thought it was a pain to write python scripts over and over, so I built a tool on top of Pandas to solve my own frustration and as a personal hobby. The goal was to make it so I didn't have to start from the ground up and rewrite and keep track of each script for each data source I had.

**What I Built:**  
A visual transformation tool with some features I thought might interest this community:

1. **Python execution on a row-by-row basis** \- Write Python once per field, save the mapping, and process. It applies each field's mapping logic to each row and returns the result without loops
2. **Visual logic builder** that generates Python from the drag and drop interface. It can re-parse the python so you can go back and edit form the UI again
3. **AI Co-Pilot** that can write Python logic based on your requirements
4. **No environment setup** \- just upload your data and start transforming
5. **Handles nested JSON** with a simple dot notation for complex structures

Here's a screenshot of the logic builder in action:

https://preview.redd.it/znh4fom8y9se1.png?width=2690&format=png&auto=webp&s=2daf229aab2f5de272c4f5668a782d8011ff3207

I'd love some feedback from people who deal with data transformations regularly. If anyone wants to give it a try feel free to shoot me a message or comment, and I can give you lifetime access if the app is of use. Not trying to sell here, just looking for some feedback and thoughts since I just built it.

**Technical Details:**

* Supports CSV, Excel, and JSON inputs/outputs, concatenating files, header & delimiter selection
* Transformations are saved as editable mapping files
* Handles large datasets by processing chunks in parallel
* Built on Pandas. Supports Pandas and re libraries

[BIGQUERY] How long does it take for a backfill and for the buffer resulting from that to clear?,"Hey all, 

1. I have two tables which are about 20-30 gbs and I created a backfill for them as I noticed that two days data was missing, now after an hour the backfill completed, now I am seeing some items in the streaming buffer, I need to update my seniors when the data is ready for analysis, so when can I safely say the data is present?

2. Also, one more question, if I insert a row manually into Bigquery and then create a backfill for it to fetch the data again from transactional database, will the entry I added manually (which doesn't exist in transactional database) be erased?

3. Is there a way to track the ingestion of data into BigQuery?

Hello all! I'm excited to dive into **ADF** and try out some new things.

Here, you can see we have a copy data activity that transfers files from the source ADLS to the raw ADLS location. Then, we have a Lookup named **Lkp\_archivepath** which retrieves values from the SQL server, known as the Metastore. This will get values such as **archive\_path** and **archive\_delete\_flag** (typically it will be Y or N, and sometimes the parameter will be missing as well). After that, we have a copy activity that copies files from the source ADLS to the archive location. Now, I'm encountering an issue as I'm trying to introduce this archive delete flag concept.

If the **archive\_delete\_flag** is '**Y**', it should not delete the files from the source, but it should delete the files if the **archive\_delete\_flag** is '**N**', '' or NULL, depending on the Metastore values. How can I make this work?

How would you handle the ingestion of thousands of files ?,"Hello,
I’m facing a philosophical question at work and I can’t find an answer that would put my brain at ease. 

Basically we work with Databricks and Pyspark for ingestion and transformation.

We have a new data provider that sends crypted and zipped files to an s3 bucket. There are a couple of thousands of files (2 years of historic).

We wanted to use dataloader from databricks. It’s basically a spark stream that scans folders, finds the files that you never ingested (it keeps track in a table) and reads the new files only and write them.
The problem is that dataloader doesn’t handle encrypted and zipped files (json files inside).

We can’t unzip files permanently. 

My coworker proposed that we use the autoloader to find the files (that it can do) and in that spark stream use the for each batch method to apply a lambda that does:
- get the file name (current row)
-decrypt and unzip
-hash the files (to avoid duplicates in case of failure)
-open the unzipped file using spark
-save in the final table using spark 

I argued that it’s not the right place to do all that and since it’s not the use case of autoloader it’s not a good practice, he argues that spark is distributed and that’s the only thing we care since it allows us to do what we need quickly even though it’s hard to debug (and we need to pass the s3 credentials to each executor using the lambda…)

I proposed a homemade solution which isn’t the most optimal, but it seems better and easier to maintain which is:
- use boto paginator to find files
- decrypt and unzip each file 
- write then json in the team bucket/folder
-create a monitoring table in which we save the file name, hash, status (ok/ko) and exceptions if there are any

He argues that this is not efficient since it’ll only use one single node cluster and not parallelised. 

I never encountered such use case before and I’m kind of stuck, I read a lot of literature but everything seems very generic. 

Edit: we only receive 2 to 3 files daily per data feed (150mo per file on average) but we have 2 years of historical data which amounts to around 1000 files. So we need 1 run for all the historic then a daily run. 
Every feed ingested is a class instantiation (a job on a cluster with a config) so it doesn’t matter if we have 10 feeds. 

Edit2: 1000 files roughly summed to 130go after unzipping. Not sure of average zip/json file though. 

What do you people think of this? Any advices ?

Parquet Nested Type to JSON in C++/Rust,"Hi Reddit community! This is my first Reddit post and I’m hoping I could get some help with this task I’m stuck with please!

I read a parquet file and store it in an arrow table. I want to read a parquet complex/nested column and convert it into a JSON object. I use C++ so I’m searching for libraries/tools preferably in C++ but if not, then I can try to integrate it with rust. 
What I want to do:
Say there is a parquet column in my file of type (arbitrary, just to showcase complexity): List(Struct(List(Struct(int,string,List(Struct(int, bool)))), bool))
I want to process this into a JSON object (or a json formatted string, then I can convert that into a json object). I do not want to flatten it out for my current use case. 

What I have found so far:
1. Parquet's inbuilt toString functions don’t really work with structs (they’re just good for debugging)
2. haven’t found anything in C++ that would do this without me having to writing a custom recursive logic, even with rapidjson
3. tried Polars with Rust but didn’t get a Json yet. 

I know I can get write my custom logic to create a json formatted string, but there must be some existing libraries that do this? I've been asked to not write a custom code because they're difficult to maintain and easy to break :)

Database design problem for many to many data relationship...need suggestions,"I have to come up with a database design working on postgres. I have to migrate at the end almost trillions volumes of data into a postgres DB wherein CRUD operations can be run most efficiently. The data present is in the form of a many to many relationship. How the data looks is:  
  
In my old data base i have a value T1 which is connected to on average 700 values (like x1,x2,x3...x700). Here in the old DB we are saving 700 records of this connection. Similarly other values like T2,T3,T100 all have multiple connections each having a separate row

Use case:  
We need to make updates,deletions and inserts to both values of T and values of X  
for example,  
I am given That value T1 instead of 700 connections of X has now 800 connections...so i must update or insert all the new connections corresponding to T1  
And like wise if I am given , we need to update all T values X1 (say X1 has 200 connection of T) i need to insert/update or delete T values associated with X1.

  
for now, I was thinking of aggregating my data in the form of a jsonb column  
where  
Column T             Column X (jsonb)  
T1                           {""value"":\[X1,X2,X3.....X700\]}

But i will have to create another similar table where i keep column T as jsonb. Since any updates in one table needs to be synced to the other any errors may cause it to be out of sync.

Also the time taken to read and update a jsonb row will be high

Any other suggestions on how i should think about creating schema for my problem?",1,2,2025-04-15 09:41:51,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-15 09:41:51,9,Tuesday,274.0,1509,63.22,11,383,11.6,0,0,NEGATIVE,-0.9980979561805725,"['come', 'database', 'design', 'working', 'postgres', 'migrate', 'end', 'almost', 'trillions', 'volumes', 'data', 'postgres', 'wherein', 'crud', 'operations', 'run', 'efficiently', 'data', 'present', 'form', 'many', 'many', 'relationship', 'data', 'looks', 'old', 'data', 'base', 'value', 'connected', 'average', 'values', 'like', 'xxxx', 'old', 'saving', 'records', 'connection', 'similarly', 'values', 'like', 'ttt', 'multiple', 'connections', 'separate', 'row', 'use', 'case', 'need', 'make', 'updatesdeletions', 'inserts', 'values', 'values', 'example', 'given', 'value', 'instead', 'connections', 'connectionsso', 'must', 'update', 'insert', 'new', 'connections', 'corresponding', 'like', 'wise', 'given', 'need', 'update', 'values', 'say', 'connection', 'need', 'insertupdate', 'delete', 'values', 'associated', 'thinking', 'aggregating', 'data', 'form', 'jsonb', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'jsonb', 'valuexxxx', 'create', 'another', 'similar', 'table', 'keep', 'column', 'jsonb', 'since', 'updates', 'one', 'table', 'needs', 'synced', 'errors', 'may', 'cause', 'sync', 'also', 'time', 'taken', 'read', 'update', 'jsonb', 'row', 'high', 'suggestions', 'think', 'creating', 'schema', 'problem']",come database design working postgres migrate end almost trillions volumes data postgres wherein crud operations run efficiently data present form many many relationship data looks old data base value connected average values like xxxx old saving records connection similarly values like ttt multiple connections separate row use case need make updatesdeletions inserts values values example given value instead connections connectionsso must update insert new connections corresponding like wise given need update values say connection need insertupdate delete values associated thinking aggregating data form jsonb column column column jsonb valuexxxx create another similar table keep column jsonb since updates one table needs synced errors may cause sync also time taken read update jsonb row high suggestions think creating schema problem,Mid,2,2,"files, need, tables, spark, database, source, table, api, query, create, run, event, file, csv, read, logic, case, around, write, json, schema, script, per, changes, datasets, load, excel, store, parquet, directly, function, processes, design, raw, fact, glue, column, created, metadata, dataset, events, track, values, errors, batch, row, ingestion, import, view, cases, metrics, method, error, external, blob, dimensions, ads, separate, postgres, either, transformations, dimension, records, extract, form, mysql, request, processed, format, transactional, updates, pull, params, wont, names, requires, scripts, runs, rest, connection, workloads, types, bronze, cdc, mapping, operations, dataframes, validation, environment, hub, object, inside, typically, loading, automatically, views, match, install, show, download, iot, require, reads, refresh, unique, order, overhead, bucket, allow, metastore, checks, becomes, split, target, relationships, location, export, sales, checkout, flask, ever, loaded, convert, historical, stored, extraction, properly, sends, purposes, thousands, flat, breaking, ingested, payload, plain, formats, string, vpc, linked, node, rds, roughly, joining, destination, incremental, fetch, developers, exist, public, returned, consists, goes, text, select, matters, extracted",7.3,6.5,169.7,-0.72,1038.3,51.9,9.4,253.4,10.3,22.6,20.4,63,152,50,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

Switching batch jobs to streaming,"Hi folks. My company is trying to switch some batch jobs to streaming. The current method is that the data are streaming data through Kafka, then there's a Spark streaming job that consumes the data and appends them to a raw table (with schema defined, so not 100% raw). Then we have some scheduled batch jobs (also Spark) that read data from the raw table, transform the data, load them into destination tables, and show them in the dashboards. We use Databricks for storage (Unity catalog) and compute (Spark), but use something else for dashboards.

Now we are trying to switch these scheduled batch jobs into streaming, since the incoming data are already streaming anyway, why not make use of it and turn our dashboards into realtime. It makes sense from business perspective too.

However, we've been facing some difficulty in rewriting the transformation jobs from batch to streaming. Turns out, Spark streaming doesn't support some imporant operations in batch. Here are a few that I've found so far:

1. Spark streaming doesn't support window function (e.g. : ROW\_NUMBER() OVER (...)). Our batch transformations have a lot of these.
2. Joining streaming dataframes is more complicated, as you have to deal with windows and watermarks (I guess this is important for dealing with unbounded data). So it breaks many joining logic in the batch jobs.
3. Aggregations are also more complicated. For example you can't do this: raw\_df -> get aggregated df from raw\_df -> join aggregated\_df with raw\_df

So far I have been working around these limitations by using Foreachbatch and using intermediary tables (Databricks delta table). However, I'm starting to question this approach, as the pipelines get more complicated. Another method would be refactoring the entire transformation queries to conform both the business logic and streaming limitations, which is probably not feasible in our scenario.

Have any of you encountered such scenario and how did you deal with it? Or maybe do you have some suggestions or ideas?

Practical Implementation of Data Warehouses with Spark (and Redshift),"Serious question to those who have done some data warehousing where Spark/Glue is the transformation engine, bonus if the data warehouse is Redshift.

This is my first time putting a data warehouse in place, and , I am doing so with AWS Glue and Redshift. The data load is incremental.

While in theory dimensional modeling ( star schemas to be exact ) is not hard, I am finding a hard time implementing the actual model.

I want to know how are these dimensional modeling concepts are actually implemented, the following is  my thoughts about how I understand some theoretical concepts and the way I find gaps between them and the actual practice.

**Avoiding duplicates in both fact and dimension tables** –does this happen in the Spark job or Redshift itself? 

I feel like for transactional fact tables it is not a problem, but for dimensions, it is not straight forward: you need to insure uniqueness of entries for all the table not just the chunk you loaded during this run and this raises the above question, whether it is done in Spark, and in this case we will need to somehow load the dimension table  in dataframes so that we can filter new data loads, or in redshidt, and in this case we just load everything new to Redshift and delegate upserts and duplication checks to Redshift.

  
And speaking of uniqueness of entries in dimension tables ( I know it is getting long, bear with me, we are almost there xD) , we have to also allow exceptions, because when dealing with **SCD type 2,** we must allow duplicate entries and update the old ones to be depricated, so again how is this exception implemented practically? 

**Surrogate keys** – Generate in Spark (eg. UUIDs/hashes?) or rely on Redshift `IDENTITY` for example?

Surrogate keys are going to serve as primary keys for both our fact and dimension tables, so they have to be unique, again do we generate them in Spark then load to, Redshift or do we just make Redshift handle these for us and not worry about uniqueness? 

**Fact-dim integrity** – Resolve FKs in Spark or after loading to Redshift?

Another concern arises when talking about surrogate keys, each fact table has to point to its dimensions with FKs, which in reality will be the surrogate keys of the dimensions, so these columns need to be filled with the right values, I am wondering whether this is done in Spark, and in this case we will have to again load the dimensions from Redshift in Spark dataframes and extract the right values of FKs, or can this be done in Reshift????

Example for complex data pipeline,"Hi community,

After working as a data analyst for several years, I've noticed a gap in tools for interactively exploring complex ETL pipeline dependencies. Many solutions handle smaller pipelines well, but struggle with 200+ tasks.

For larger pipelines, we need robust traversal features, like collapsing/expanding nodes to focus on specific sections during development or debugging. I've used `networkx` and `mermaid` for subgraph visualization, but an interactive UI would be more efficient.

I've developed a prototype and am seeking example cases to test it. I'm looking for pipelines with 60+ tasks and complex dependencies. I'm particularly interested in the challenges you face with these large pipelines. At my workplace, we have a 1500+ task pipeline, and I'm curious if this is a typical scale.

Specifically, I'd like to know:

* What challenges do you face when visualizing and managing large pipelines?
* Are pipelines with 1500+ tasks common?
* What features would you find most useful in a tool for this purpose?

If you can share sanitized examples or describe the complexity of your pipelines, it would be very helpful.

Now trying to shift job but 4 out of 5 jobs i see are asking for  AWS (i am targeting only product companies or  GCC) . Is self learning AWS for DE possible.

Has anyone shifted from Azure stack DE to AWS ?

"What Python libraries, functions, methods, etc. do data engineers frequently use during the extraction and transformation steps of their ETL work?","I am currently learning and applying data engineering into my job. I am a data analyst with three years of experience. I am trying to learn ETL to construct automated data pipelines for my reports.

Using Python programming language, I am trying to extract data from Excel file and API data sources. I am then trying to manipulate that data. In essence, I am basically trying to use a more efficient and powerful form of Microsoft's Power Query.

What are the most common Python libraries, functions, methods, etc. that data engineers frequently use during the extraction and transformation steps of their ETL work?

P.S.

Please let me know if you recommend any books or YouTube channels so that I can further improve my skillset within the ETL portion of data engineering.

Thank you all for your help. I sincerely appreciate all your expertise. I am new to data engineering, so apologies if some of my terminology is wrong.

"Built a real-time e-commerce data pipeline with Kinesis, Spark, Redshift & QuickSight — looking for feedback","I recently completed a real-time ETL pipeline project as part of my data engineering portfolio, and I’d love to share it here and get some feedback from the community.

# What it does:

* Streams transactional data using **Amazon Kinesis**
* Backs up raw data in **S3** (Parquet format)
* Processes and transforms data with **Apache Spark**
* Loads the transformed data into **Redshift Serverless**
* Orchestrates the pipeline with **Apache Airflow (Docker)**
* Visualizes insights through a **QuickSight dashboard**

# Key Metrics Visualized:

* Total Revenue
* Orders Over Time
* Average Order Value
* Top Products
* Revenue by Category (donut chart)

I built this to practice real-time ingestion, transformation, and visualization in a scalable, production-like setup using AWS-native services.

How Universities Are Using Data Warehousing to Meet Compliance and Funding Demands,"Higher ed institutions are under pressure to improve reporting, optimize funding efforts, and centralize siloed systems — but most are still working with outdated or disconnected data infrastructure.

This blog breaks down how a modern data warehouse helps universities:

* Streamline compliance reporting
* Support grant/funding visibility
* Improve decision-making across departments

It’s a solid resource for anyone working in edtech, institutional research, or data architecture in education.

What are the essential starter coding languages for someone with no experience in Data Science / Data Engineering / Business Analysis?,"I'm currently exploring potential career paths in Data Science, Data Engineering, and Business Analysis. I don't have any prior coding experience, and I'm trying to figure out where to begin.

What would you say are the essential programming languages or tools a beginner should learn first to build a solid foundation in any (or all) of these fields?

Some follow-up questions I'm also curious about:

* Should I focus on one field first (like Data Science) and then branch out, or is there overlap in the skill sets?
* How important is SQL compared to Python or R at the beginning?
* Are there any specific resources (courses, books, platforms) you'd recommend for absolute beginners?
* How long did it take you to feel confident in your coding abilities when transitioning into one of these fields?

"What are the best open-source alternatives to SQL Server, SSAS, SSIS, Power BI, and Informatica?","I’m exploring open-source replacements for the following tools:
	•	SQL Server as data warehouse 
	•	SSAS (Tabular/OLAP)
	•	SSIS
	•	Power BI
	•	Informatica

What would you recommend as better open-source tools for each of these?

Attempting to Solve the Cross-Platform AI Billing Challenge as a Solo Engineer/Founder - Need Feedback,"Hey Everyone

I'm a self-taught solo engineer/developer (with university + multi-year professional software engineer experience) developing a solution for a growing problem I've noticed many organizations are facing: managing and optimizing spending across multiple AI and LLM platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Midjourney, etc.).

# The Problem I'm Research / Attempting to Address:

From my own research and conversations with various teams, I'm seeing consistent challenges:

* No centralized way to track spending across multiple AI providers
* Difficulty attributing costs to specific departments, projects, or use cases
* Inconsistent billing cycles creating budgeting headaches
* Unexpected cost spikes with limited visibility into their causes
* Minimal tools for forecasting AI spending as usage scales

# My Proposed Solution

Building a platform-agnostic billing management solution that would:

* Provide a unified dashboard for all AI platform spending
* Enable project/team attribution for better cost allocation
* Offer usage analytics to identify optimization opportunities
* Include customizable alerts for budget management
* Generate forecasts based on historical usage patterns

# I Need Your Input:

Before I go too deep into development, I want to make sure I'm building something that genuinely solves problems:

1. What features would be most valuable for your organization?
2. What platforms beyond the major LLM providers should we support?
3. How would you ideally integrate this with your existing systems?
4. What reporting capabilities are most important to you?
5. How do you currently handle this challenge (manual spreadsheets, custom tools, etc.)?

Seriously would love your insights and/or recommendations of other projects I could build because I'm pretty good at launching MVPs extremely quickly (few hours to 1 week MAX).",2,1,2025-04-18

Feedback on my MCD for a training management system?,"Hey everyone! 👋

I’m working on a **Conceptual Data Model (MCD)** for a training management system and I’d love to get some feedback

The main elements of the system are:

* **Formateurs** (trainers) teach **Modules**
* Each **Module** is scheduled into one or more **Séances** (sessions)
* **Stagiaires** (trainees) can participate in sessions, and their participation can be marked as ""Present"" or ""Absent""
* If a trainee is absent, there can be a **Justification** linked to that absence

I decided to merge the ""Assistance"" (Assister) and “Absence” (Absenter) relationships into a single **Participation** relationship with a possible attribute like `Status`, and added a link from participation to a **Justification** (0 or 1).

Does this structure look correct to you? Any suggestions to improve the logic, simplify it further, or potential pitfalls I should watch out for?

Thanks in advance for your help
