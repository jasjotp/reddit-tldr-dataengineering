1kc2mff,Guess skills are not transferable,"Found this on LinkedIn posted by a recruiter. It’s pretty bad if they filter out based on these criteria. It sounds to me like “I’m looking for someone to drive a Toyota but you’ve only driven Honda!”

1kc5giw,Goodbye PyDeequ: A new take on data quality in Spark,"Hey folks,  
I’ve worked with Spark for years and tried using PyDeequ for data quality — but ran into too many blockers:

* No row-level visibility
* No custom checks
* Clunky config
* Little community activity

So I built **🚀 SparkDQ** — a lightweight, plugin-ready DQ framework for PySpark with Python-native and declarative config (YAML, JSON, etc.).

Still early stage, but already offers:

* Row + aggregate checks
* Fail-fast or quarantine logic
* Custom check support
* Zero bloat (just PySpark + Pydantic)

If you're working with Spark and care about data quality, I’d love your thoughts:

1kcd6ul,"StatQL – live, approximate SQL for huge datasets and many tenants","I built StatQL after spending too many hours waiting for scripts to crawl hundreds of tenant databases in my last job (we had a db-per-tenant setup).

With StatQL you write one SQL query, hit Enter, and see a first estimate in seconds—even if the data lives in dozens of Postgres DBs, a giant Redis keyspace, or a filesystem full of logs.

What makes it tick:

* A sampling loop keeps a fixed-size reservoir (say 1 M rows/keys/files) that’s refreshed continuously and evenly.
* An aggregation loop reruns your SQL on that reservoir, streaming back value ± 95 % error bars.
* As more data gets scanned by the first loop, the reservoir becomes more representative of entire population.
* Wildcards like pg.?.?.?.orders or fs.?.entries let you fan a single query across clusters, schemas, or directory trees.

Everything runs locally: `pip install statql` and `python -m statql` turns your laptop into the engine. Current connectors: PostgreSQL, Redis, filesystem—more coming soon.

Solo side project, feedback welcome.

1kcbp7q,Are there any good data platforms that have good built in project documentation?,"With all of the bells and whistles that these modern data platforms have I'd expect them all to have basic IDE style pop-up documentation tooltips when querying from a table or joining on another. I'm only really familiar with a handful of these platforms but even just selecting a column I normally have to go and dig up it's data type from some other interface, let alone getting any of the engineers' documentation on it.

Snowflake for instance allows us to create `comments` pinned to tables, views, schemas , columns. The lot basically. Why are these comments so hidden to our users whilst they're actually writing the queries that make use of these tables, columns, etc?

Our team goes to a decent amount of effort to build useful and readable documentation around each table but is it any use if the end users have to pull up the docs in a separate tab before they understand that they're using the wrong column for their joins?

This feels like something that's not too hard to implement, I know having objects tagged with a comment or description is already a nice to have in the data world but surely we can do better? Please tell me that I've just been unlucky and most solutions do this cleanly out of the box.

I'm trying to practice building a full data pipeline from A to Z using the following architecture. I'm a beginner and tried to put together something that seems optimal using different technologies.

Here's the flow I came up with:

📍 Events → Kafka →  Spark Streaming →  AWS S3 → ❄️ Snowpipe →  Airflow → dbt → 📊 BI (Power BI)

I have a few questions before diving in:

* Does this architecture make sense overall?
* Is using AWS S3 as a data lake feeding into Snowflake a common and solid approach? (From what I read, Snowflake seems more scalable and easier to work with than Redshift.)
* Do you see anything that looks off or could be improved?

1kc6nen,Shopify GraphQL Data Ingestion,"Hi everyone 

Full disclosure. I’m a data engineer for 3 years and now I’m facing a challenge.
Most of my prior needs were develop my pipeline using DBT and Fivetran as the data ingestion tool. But the company I’m working no longer approves the use of both tools and now I need to implement these two layers (ingestion and transformation) using GCP environment 
The basic architecture of the application I have approved, it will be :
- cloud Run generating csv. One per table/day
- cloud composer calling sql files to run the transformations

The difficult part (for me) is the Python development.
This is my first actual python development, so I’m pretty new to this part, even having some theoretical knowledge of python concepts

So far I was able to create a python app that
- connect with Shopify session
- runs a graphQL query 
- generate a csv file
- upload to a gcs bucket

My current challenge is to implement a date filter into the graphQL query and creates one file for each day.

Has anyone implemented something like this ?
