1jmsyfl,SQLFlow: DuckDB for Streaming Data,"[https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow](https://github.com/turbolytics/sql-flow)

**The goal of SQLFlow is to bring the simplicity of DuckDB to streaming data.**

SQLFlow is a high-performance stream processing engine that simplifies building data pipelines by enabling you to define them using just SQL. Think of SQLFLow as a lightweight, modern Flink.

SQLFlow models stream-processing as SQL queries using the [DuckDB SQL dialect](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/introduction.html). Express your entire stream processing pipeline—ingestion, transformation, and enrichment—as a single SQL statement and configuration file.

Process [10's of thousands of events per second](https://sql-flow.com/docs/tutorials/clickhouse-sink) on a single machine with low memory overhead, using Python, DuckDB, Arrow and Confluent Python Client.

Tap into the DuckDB ecosystem of tools and libraries to build your stream processing applications. SQLFlow supports [parquet](https://sql-flow.com/docs/tutorials/s3-parquet-sink), csv, json and [iceberg](https://sql-flow.com/docs/tutorials/iceberg-sink).

1jmsfs6,Interactive Change Data Capture (CDC) Playground,"I've built an interactive demo for CDC to help explain how it works.

The app currently shows the transaction log-based and query-based CDC approaches.

Change Data Capture (CDC) is a design pattern that tracks changes (inserts, updates, deletes) in a database and makes those changes available to downstream systems in real-time or near real-time.

CDC is super useful for a variety of use cases:

\- Real-time data replication between operational databases and data warehouses or lakehouses

\- Keeping analytics systems up to date without full batch reloads

\- Synchronizing data across microservices or distributed systems

\- Feeding event-driven architectures by turning database changes into event streams

\- Maintaining materialized views or derived tables with fresh data

\- Simplifying ETL/ELT pipelines by processing only changed records

And many more!

Let me know what you think and if there's any functionality missing that could be interesting to showcase.",51,4,dan_the_lion,2025-03-29 18:12:13,https://www.change-data-capture.com/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-29 18:12:13,18,Saturday,146.0,975,34.6,5,236,15.6,0,1
1jnc3zk,When to use a surrogate key instead of a primary key?,"Hi all!

I am reviewing for interviews and the following question come to mind.

If **surrogate keys** are supposed to be unique identifiers that don't have real world meaning AND if **primary keys** are supposed to reliably identify and distinguish between each individual record (which also don't have real world meaning), then why will someone use a surrogate key? Wouldn't using primary keys be the same? Is there any case in which surrogate keys are the way to go?

P.S: Both surrogate and primary keys are auto generated by DB. Right?

P.S.1: I understand that a surrogate key doesn't necessarily have to be the a primary key, so considering that both have no real meaning outside the DB, then I wonder what the purpose of surrogate keys are.

P.S.2: At work (in different projects), we mainly use natural keys for analytical workloads and primary keys for uniquely identifying a given row. So I am wondering on which kind of cases/projects these surrogate keys will fit.

https://reddit.com/link/1jnh7pu/video/wcl9lru6zure1/player

You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/Fszta/dbt-column-lineage), and the package on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/dbt-col-lineage/0.1.1/)

Basically, it works by combining dbt's manifest and catalog with some compiled SQL parsing magic (big shoutout to sqlglot!).

I've built it as a CLI, keeping the syntax similar to dbt-core, with upstream and downstream selectors.

* Focus on compatibility with more SQL dialects
* Improve the parser to handle complex syntax specific to certain dialects
* Making the UI less... basic. It's kinda rough right now, plus some information could be added such as materialization type, col typing etc

1jni0xm,Transitioning from DE to ML Engineer in 2025?,"I am a DE with 2 years of experience, but my background is mainly in statistics. I have been offered a position as an ML Engineer (de facto Data Scientist, but also working on deployment - it is a smaller IT department, so my scope of duties will be simply quite wide). 

The position is interesting, and there are multiple pros and cons to it (that I do not want to discuss in this post). However my question is a bit more general - in 2025, with all the LLMs performing quite well with code generation and fixing, which path would you say is more stable long-term - sticking to DE and becoming better and better at it, or moving more towards ML and doing data science projects?

Furthermore, I also wonder about growth in each field - in ML/DS, my fear is that I am not PhD nor excellent mathematician. In DE, on the other hand, my fear is lack of my solid CS/SWE foundations (as my background is more in statistics). 

Ultimately, it is just an honest question, as I am very curious of your perspective on the matter - does moving towards data science projects (XGBoost and other algorithms) in 2025 from DE (PySpark and Airflow) makes sense in 2025? Which path would you say is more reasonable, and what kind of growth I can expect for each position? Personally I am a bit reluctant to switch simply since I have already dedicated 2 years to growing as an DE, but on the other hand I also see how much more and more of my tasks can be automated.

1jndfr9,Building a Cloud-Based Data Pipeline for Personal Use/Learning/Projects,"I am a data/functional analyst looking to get a better grasp on 'end-to-end data management and processing' (in quotations as that's the term my direct lead used when we aligned regarding my career objectives for the year, which definitely matches with my current interests).

Given this objective, my own interest in gaining a better grasp on general principles and functions of Data Engineering (and later on, Data Science), as well as a personal project I'm looking to finish for myself/my own portfolio by the end of the year, I'm looking for a cloud-based data pipeline solution for me to spend my role's training stipend on -- though I'm willing (and allowed) to use some of my personal funds on this as well since it's both for career progression and personal fun.

I started looking for small-scale subscriptions for some of the platforms we've previously used at work (AWS, Databricks), but the consensus I've gotten is that cost-wise, I'm potentially better off with multiple smaller platforms that I can just weave together, instead of going for platforms normally designed for enterprise use. And so I come here for help!

*(Though if this is not the right community for me to ask this, please let me know where instead)*

# Budget and Scope

* Base budget is a $200 stipend from our department, which refreshes at the end of the year
* I'm willing to add another $200-300/year, if necessary
* I'm from South-East Asia (converting our local currency, in case regional pricing matters)
* I prefer platforms/solutions that come with upfront costs instead of per-pull/use costs, so that's it's easier to manage the finances involved
* Languages I'm comfortable with are Python and SQL, since these are what I mainly use for work, but willing to learn basics of new languages where necessary 
* Since I will be using my personal computer, which is not that powerful currently, I am looking for a pipeline/platform that I can use completely via cloud (including running training models) 

# Learning Objectives 

*(aka things I want my platform/s to be able to do)*

**1. Data Gathering/Ingestion/Validation/Transformation/Storage**

* Obviously not too familiar with this step currently, so I ended up lumping a bunch of them together, but essentially ETL
* In terms of data I intend to use, I have three main sources I intend to work my way through, from simple to complex: **(1)** will be starting with ingesting CSV files I get from third-party free data providers like Kaggle, **(2)** then moving on to structured databases from sports stat sites such as BBREF, before  eventually work my way to **(3)** automating data collection from publicly available video games I normally play (Dota 2, Path of Exile -- if it matters)
* I want to be able to load these into SQL tables that I can regularly query form

**2. Data Querying and Extract Cloud Storage**

* I want to then be able to set it up so that I can easily query and then store-via-cloud what I need.
* To make my intention clear, most of my work experience is with AWS Athena and S3, so I hope to get platforms that function similarly.

**3. Cloud-Based Data Processing, Machine Learning, and Visualization**

* I currently do majority of my post-query data processing and modelling locally on my work laptop on Jupyter (via the Anaconda distribution), but one of my key objectives is learning to do all of these on cloud (especially since my peronal computer I'll be using would obviously not be as powerful as what I use for work)
* I definitely prefer Notebook-like environments, so perhaps something like AWS EMR
* My main experience at this level is mainly with Python (using specific packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Numpy, Sklearn, etc.), but I'm looking to do more PySpark as well

**4. EXTRA/OPTIONAL: Dashboard Creation and Hosting**

* If I can get a platform/pipeline that will allow me to host interactive dashboards for me to just embed in my portfolio, that would be a plus, but I am very easily willing to drop this should it not fit my budget

#  Final Remarks

* Want to learn ETL, and cloud-based data processing on a personal data pipeline and processing platform/solution that also has SQL capabilities -- in line with my career and personal learning objectives for the year 
* Tried looking into personal subscriptions for 360 solutions like Databricks and AWS Sagemaker Unified Studio, but was told that for what I want I might be better off with patching together T2 solutions or something along those lines -- but I imagine this would be much more tricky to set up ",2,1,bacon9001,2025-03-30 14:20:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jndfr9/building_a_cloudbased_data_pipeline_for_personal/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-30 14:20:16,14,Sunday,778.0,4571,10.41,11,1141,20.6,0,1

1jmzte8,Need help for a small website design choices,"I am working on a website whose job is to serve data from MongoDb. Just textual data in row format nothing complicated. 

This is my current setup: client sends a request to cloudfront that manages the cache and triggers a lambda for a cache miss to query from MongoDB. I also use signedurl for security purposes for each request. 

I am not an expert that but I think cloud front can handle DDoS attacks etc. Does this setup work or do I need to bring in API Gateway into the fold? I don’t have any user login etc. and no form on the website (no sql injection risk I guess). I don’t know much about network security etc but have heard horror stories of websites getting hacked etc. Hence am a bit paranoid before launching the website. 

Based on some reading, I came to the conclusion that I need to use AWS WAF + API Gateway for dynamic queries and AWS + cloud front for static pages. And lambda should be associated with API Gateway to connect with MongoDB and API Gateway does rate limiting and caching (user authentication is no big a problem here). I wonder if cloudfront is even needed or should just stick with the current architecture I have.

Also, I think it's still super early to go full Fabric (DP-600 or even DP-700), because the job demand is still not really there. Most jobs still demand strong grounding in Azure services even in the wake of Fabric adoption (POCing…).

So of course here, it’s retiring literally tomorrow unfortunately. I have passed the exam with a high score (900+). Also, I have worked (during internship) directly with MS Fabric only. So I would say some skills actually transfer quite nicely (ex: ADF ~ FDF).

---

### Some notes on resources for future exams:

I have relied primarily on [@tybulonazure](https://www.youtube.com/@tybulonazure)’s excellent YouTube channel (DP-203 playlist). It’s really great (watch on 1.8x – 2x speed).  
Now going back to Fabric, I have seen he has pivoted to Fabric-centric content — also a great news!

I also used the official “Guide” book (2024 version), which I found to be a surprisingly good way of structuring your learning. I hope equivalents for Fabric will be similar (TBS…).

---

The labs on Microsoft Learn are honestly **poorly designed** for what they offer.  
**Tip:** @tybul has video labs too — *use these*.  
And for the exams, always focus on **conceptual understanding**, not rote memorization.

Another **important (and mostly ignored)** tip:  
Focus on the **“best practices”** sections of Azure services in Microsoft Learn — I’ve read a lot of MS documentation, and those parts are often more helpful on the exam than the main pages.

---

**Examtopics** is obviously very helpful — but **read the comments**, they’re essential!

---

Finally, I do think it’s a shame it’s retiring — because the “traditional” Azure environment knowledge seems to be a sort of industry standard for companies. Also, the Fabric pricing model seems quite aggressive.

So for juniors, it would have been really good to still be able to have this background knowledge as a base layer.",16,2,EducatedEarthian-99,2025-03-30 19:48:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jnktzw/passed_dp203_some_thoughts_on_its_retiring/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-30 19:48:14,19,Sunday,344.0,2100,65.32,23,507,10.9,1,0

1jnisk7,What is expected of me as a Junior Data Engineer in 2025?,"Hello all, 

I've been interviewing for a proper Junior Data Engineer position and have been doing well in the rounds so far. I've done my recruiter call, HR call and coding assessment. Waiting on the 4th.

I want to be great. I am willing to learn from those of you who are more experienced than me.  
  
Can anyone share examples from their own careers on attitude, communication, soft skills, time management, charisma, willingness to learn and other soft skills that I should keep in mind. Or maybe what I should not do instead.

How should I approach the technical side? There are 1000's of technologies to learn. So I have been learning basics with soft skills and hoping everything works out.

3 years ago I had a labour job and did well in that too. So this grind has caused me to rewire my brain to work in tech and corporate work. I am aiming for 20 years more in this field.

Any insights are appreciated.

1jni0xm,Transitioning from DE to ML Engineer in 2025?,"I am a DE with 2 years of experience, but my background is mainly in statistics. I have been offered a position as an ML Engineer (de facto Data Scientist, but also working on deployment - it is a smaller IT department, so my scope of duties will be simply quite wide). 

The position is interesting, and there are multiple pros and cons to it (that I do not want to discuss in this post). However my question is a bit more general - in 2025, with all the LLMs performing quite well with code generation and fixing, which path would you say is more stable long-term - sticking to DE and becoming better and better at it, or moving more towards ML and doing data science projects?

Furthermore, I also wonder about growth in each field - in ML/DS, my fear is that I am not PhD nor excellent mathematician. In DE, on the other hand, my fear is lack of my solid CS/SWE foundations (as my background is more in statistics). 

Ultimately, it is just an honest question, as I am very curious of your perspective on the matter - does moving towards data science projects (XGBoost and other algorithms) in 2025 from DE (PySpark and Airflow) makes sense in 2025? Which path would you say is more reasonable, and what kind of growth I can expect for each position? Personally I am a bit reluctant to switch simply since I have already dedicated 2 years to growing as an DE, but on the other hand I also see how much more and more of my tasks can be automated.

1jnh5oy,"Struggling with Career Path – Stuck in Java, Want to Return to Data Engineering (6.5 YOE)","I've been working in IT for the past 6.5 years. I started as a Java Developer for a year before transitioning into Data Engineering, where I worked with Airflow, GCP, Python, and SQL (BigQuery).

In June 2022, I joined my second company as a Data Engineer, but after just six months, the project was shelved, and I was moved to a Java-based project (Spring Boot, Kafka, etc.). This happened during a market downturn and layoffs, so I was grateful to still have a job.

Now, after two years in this role, I feel stuck. I struggle with coding, don’t enjoy Java, and constantly feel like an imposter. I know for sure that I don’t want to continue in Java and Spring Boot. However, I’ve stayed in this role because it’s high-paying, and I have family responsibilities (supporting a family of five).

I want to transition back into Data Engineering, but now the job market expects a higher level of expertise given my experience and salary range. I’m unsure about the best way to upskill and make this switch without a major setback.

How can I strategically transition back into Data Engineering while balancing financial stability? Would love advice from those who have made similar career shifts.

This made me sickkk I never knew this at all!

So does this mean serialisation and de-serialisation?? 
I see these terms vary across many architecture ex: In spark they mention these terminologies when the data needs to searched at different instances.. they say data needs to be de-serialised which takes time...

But I am not clear how do I need to think when I hear these terminologies!!!

1jnlsu5,Example for complex data pipeline,"Hi community,

After working as a data analyst for several years, I've noticed a gap in tools for interactively exploring complex ETL pipeline dependencies. Many solutions handle smaller pipelines well, but struggle with 200+ tasks.

For larger pipelines, we need robust traversal features, like collapsing/expanding nodes to focus on specific sections during development or debugging. I've used `networkx` and `mermaid` for subgraph visualization, but an interactive UI would be more efficient.

I've developed a prototype and am seeking example cases to test it. I'm looking for pipelines with 60+ tasks and complex dependencies. I'm particularly interested in the challenges you face with these large pipelines. At my workplace, we have a 1500+ task pipeline, and I'm curious if this is a typical scale.

Specifically, I'd like to know:

* What challenges do you face when visualizing and managing large pipelines?
* Are pipelines with 1500+ tasks common?
* What features would you find most useful in a tool for this purpose?

If you can share sanitized examples or describe the complexity of your pipelines, it would be very helpful.

1jndfr9,Building a Cloud-Based Data Pipeline for Personal Use/Learning/Projects,"I am a data/functional analyst looking to get a better grasp on 'end-to-end data management and processing' (in quotations as that's the term my direct lead used when we aligned regarding my career objectives for the year, which definitely matches with my current interests).

Given this objective, my own interest in gaining a better grasp on general principles and functions of Data Engineering (and later on, Data Science), as well as a personal project I'm looking to finish for myself/my own portfolio by the end of the year, I'm looking for a cloud-based data pipeline solution for me to spend my role's training stipend on -- though I'm willing (and allowed) to use some of my personal funds on this as well since it's both for career progression and personal fun.

I started looking for small-scale subscriptions for some of the platforms we've previously used at work (AWS, Databricks), but the consensus I've gotten is that cost-wise, I'm potentially better off with multiple smaller platforms that I can just weave together, instead of going for platforms normally designed for enterprise use. And so I come here for help!

*(Though if this is not the right community for me to ask this, please let me know where instead)*

# Budget and Scope

* Base budget is a $200 stipend from our department, which refreshes at the end of the year
* I'm willing to add another $200-300/year, if necessary
* I'm from South-East Asia (converting our local currency, in case regional pricing matters)
* I prefer platforms/solutions that come with upfront costs instead of per-pull/use costs, so that's it's easier to manage the finances involved
* Languages I'm comfortable with are Python and SQL, since these are what I mainly use for work, but willing to learn basics of new languages where necessary 
* Since I will be using my personal computer, which is not that powerful currently, I am looking for a pipeline/platform that I can use completely via cloud (including running training models) 

# Learning Objectives 

*(aka things I want my platform/s to be able to do)*

**1. Data Gathering/Ingestion/Validation/Transformation/Storage**

* Obviously not too familiar with this step currently, so I ended up lumping a bunch of them together, but essentially ETL
* In terms of data I intend to use, I have three main sources I intend to work my way through, from simple to complex: **(1)** will be starting with ingesting CSV files I get from third-party free data providers like Kaggle, **(2)** then moving on to structured databases from sports stat sites such as BBREF, before  eventually work my way to **(3)** automating data collection from publicly available video games I normally play (Dota 2, Path of Exile -- if it matters)
* I want to be able to load these into SQL tables that I can regularly query form

**2. Data Querying and Extract Cloud Storage**

* I want to then be able to set it up so that I can easily query and then store-via-cloud what I need.
* To make my intention clear, most of my work experience is with AWS Athena and S3, so I hope to get platforms that function similarly.

**3. Cloud-Based Data Processing, Machine Learning, and Visualization**

* I currently do majority of my post-query data processing and modelling locally on my work laptop on Jupyter (via the Anaconda distribution), but one of my key objectives is learning to do all of these on cloud (especially since my peronal computer I'll be using would obviously not be as powerful as what I use for work)
* I definitely prefer Notebook-like environments, so perhaps something like AWS EMR
* My main experience at this level is mainly with Python (using specific packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Numpy, Sklearn, etc.), but I'm looking to do more PySpark as well

**4. EXTRA/OPTIONAL: Dashboard Creation and Hosting**

* If I can get a platform/pipeline that will allow me to host interactive dashboards for me to just embed in my portfolio, that would be a plus, but I am very easily willing to drop this should it not fit my budget

#  Final Remarks

* Want to learn ETL, and cloud-based data processing on a personal data pipeline and processing platform/solution that also has SQL capabilities -- in line with my career and personal learning objectives for the year 
* Tried looking into personal subscriptions for 360 solutions like Databricks and AWS Sagemaker Unified Studio, but was told that for what I want I might be better off with patching together T2 solutions or something along those lines -- but I imagine this would be much more tricky to set up ",1,1,bacon9001,2025-03-30 14:20:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jndfr9/building_a_cloudbased_data_pipeline_for_personal/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-30 14:20:16,14,Sunday,778.0,4571,10.41,11,1141,20.6,0,1

we’re currently using self-hosted Airflow for our internal ETL and data workflows. It gets the job done, but I never really liked it. Feels too far away from actual Python, gets overly complex at times, and local development and testing is honestly a nightmare.

I recently stumbled upon Prefect and gave the self-hosted version a try. Really liked what I saw. Super Pythonic, easy to set up locally, modern UI - just felt right from the start.

But the problem is: the open-source version doesn’t offer user management or logging, so we’d need the Cloud version. Pricing would be around 30k USD per year, which is way above what we pay for Airflow. Even with a discount, it would still be too much for us.

Is there any way to make the community version work for a small team? Usermanagement and Audit-Logs is definitely a must for us. Or is Prefect just not realistic without going Cloud?

Would be a shame, because I really liked their approach.

1jo9b0k,Operating systems and hardware available for employees in your company,"Hey guys,

I'm working as a DE in a German IT company that has about 500 employees. The company's policy regarding operating systems the employees are allowed to use is strange and unfair (IMO). All software engineers get access to Macbooks and thus, to MacOS while all other employees that have a differnt job title ""only"" get HP elite books (that are not elite at all) that run on Windows. WSL is allowed but a native Linux is not accepted because of security reasons (I don't know which security reasons).

As far as I know the company does not want other job positions to get Macbooks because the whole updating stuff for those Macbooks  is done by an external company which is quite expensive. The Windows laptops instead are maintained by an internal team.

A lot of people are very unhappy with this situation because many of them (including me) would prefer to use Linux or MacOS. Especially all DevOps are pissed because half a year ago they also got access to MacBooks but a change in the policy means that they will have to change back to Windows laptops once their MacBooks break or become too old.

My question(s): Can you choose the OS and/or hardware in your company? Do you have a clue why Linux may not be accepted? Is it really not that safe (which I cannot think of because the company has it's own data center where a lot of Linux servers run that are actually updated by an internal team)?",2,11,VeryHardToFindAName,2025-03-31 17:48:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jo9b0k/operating_systems_and_hardware_available_for/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-31 17:48:33,17,Monday,255.0,1410,56.39,11,375,12.9,0,0

1joeg88,My company adopted a stateful REST API solution I built that's run locally on every machine. I would like to deploy it to the cloud but I am not sure that's smart. Thoughts?,"**Context:** I joined a finance consultancy a few years ago and noticed that most people in my department are frustrated with the current ""software"" our engineering team has built over decades (yes - not years, decades). The issue is that the software consists of a bundle of Python scripts that repeatedly read large CSV files whenever a user interacts with it. The master CSV file ranges in size from 20MB to 1GB.

For example, if a user wants to select an option from a dropdown menu, clicking the dropdown triggers the reading and aggregation of a 1GB file, after which the frontend is ""returned"" 20 strings (the dropdown options). By ""returned,"" I mean that a new CSV file is created somewhere on the user's local file system, and the ""frontend"" picks it up. I tested a similar functionality using a Flask REST API, and once the CSV file is loaded into virtual memory, the process takes only 100ms—compared to the current design, which takes a full minute (some of it is due to scripts needing to sort out dependencies, validation, etc.). However, our engineering team refuses to adopt web-based communication, arguing that it's not worth the effort. The idea of using a cloud-based relational database is essentially taboo; it has to be either CSV files or Python’s pickle dumps on each user's local system.

I have some experience in software engineering, so I made it my mission to redesign this legacy monster—with the blessing of a senior manager. So far, the transition has gone incredibly well. Last year, I did a soft launch of a small subset of features, and within days, every person in my department was using it.

**Question:** My current design requires users to set up a virtual environment and run an installation script that sorts out any environment variables, dependencies, etc. Each time they want to start the software, they must run a local Flask API, which interacts with a React TypeScript frontend. When the Flask API starts, it loads all necessary files into memory, does validation and other things (takes around a minute). After that, every subsequent request is easy and takes on average 100 to 200 ms. However, I dislike that each user needs a fully configured environment. Version control is also a headache since every user must manually run an update script.

I’d like to move my Flask API to the cloud so that either:

1. **A single server serves all colleagues**, or
2. **Each colleague gets a dedicated node/pod.**

The problem with a single server is that it would quickly run out of virtual memory if 100+ colleagues loaded large datasets simultaneously. The problem with one node per colleague is the complexity—it would require Kubernetes (K8s) or AWS Fargate, along with an orchestrator to manage node creation and termination, which is a significant engineering effort.

I then considered making my Flask API stateless: storing large datasets in S3, using DynamoDB for file mapping, and loading data into virtual memory on every request. I converted some sample datasets to Parquet, reducing their size significantly (down to \~10MB), but I worry about added latency. Repeatedly reading the same data (given that each user makes 1–10 requests per minute) seems highly inefficient.

Am I missing any alternatives? Based on this, a local Flask API still seems like the best option—unless I want to pay for an expensive 64GB vRAM EC2 instance or invest significant time in building a node-per-user architecture.

1jnymqg,Need Feedback on data sharing module,"
Subject: Seeking Feedback: CrossLink - Faster Data Sharing Between Python/R/C++/Julia via Arrow & Shared Memory

Hey r/dataengineering


I've been working on a project called CrossLink aimed at tackling a common bottleneck: efficiently sharing large datasets (think multi-million row Arrow tables / Pandas DataFrames / R data.frames) between processes written in different languages (Python, R, C++, Julia) when they're running on the same machine/node.
Mainly given workflows where teams have different language expertise.

The Problem:
We often end up saving data to intermediate files (CSVs are slow, Parquet is better but still involves disk I/O and serialization/deserialization overhead) just to pass data from, say, a Python preprocessing script to an R analysis script, or a C++ simulation output to Python for plotting. This can dominate runtime for data-heavy pipelines.

CrossLink's Approach:
The idea is to create a high-performance IPC (Inter-Process Communication) layer specifically for this, leveraging:
Apache Arrow: As the common, efficient in-memory columnar format.
Shared Memory / Memory-Mapped Files: Using Arrow IPC format over these mechanisms for potential minimal-copy data transfer between processes on the same host.


DuckDB: To manage persistent metadata about the shared datasets (unique IDs, names, schemas, source language, location - shmem key or mmap path) and allow optional SQL queries across them.


Essentially, it tries to create a shared data pool where different language processes can push and pull Arrow tables with minimal overhead.


Performance:
Early benchmarks on a 100M row Python -> R pipeline are encouraging, showing CrossLink is:
Roughly 16x faster than passing data via CSV files.
Roughly 2x faster than passing data via disk-based Arrow/Parquet files.

It also now includes a streaming API with backpressure and disk-spilling capabilities for handling >RAM datasets.


Architecture:
It's built around a C++ core library (libcrosslink) handling the Arrow serialization, IPC (shmem/mmap via helper classes), and DuckDB metadata interactions. Language bindings (currently Python & R functional, Julia building) expose this functionality idiomatically.


Seeking Feedback:
I'd love to get your thoughts, especially on:
Architecture: Does using Arrow + DuckDB + (Shared Mem / MMap) seem like a reasonable approach for this problem? 

Any obvious pitfalls or complexities I might be underestimating (beyond the usual fun of shared memory management and cross-platform IPC)?


Usefulness: Is this data transfer bottleneck a significant pain point you actually encounter in your work? Would a library like CrossLink potentially fit into your workflows (e.g., local data science pipelines, multi-language services running on a single server, HPC node-local tasks)?


Alternatives: What are you currently using to handle this? (Just sticking with Parquet on shared disk? Using something like Ray's object store if you're in that ecosystem? Redis? Other IPC methods?)


Appreciate any constructive criticism or insights you might have! Happy to elaborate on any part of the design.

I built this to ease the pain of moving across different scripts and languages for a single file. Wanted to know if it useful for any of you here and would be a sensible open source project to maintain.

It is currently built only for local nodes, but looking to add support with arrow flight across nodes as well.

I have two different measurement devices that both collect time-series data. My goal is to analyze the similarity between these two signals.

Although both devices measure the same phenomenon and I've converted the units to be consistent, I'm unsure whether this is sufficient for meaningful comparison, given that the devices themselves are different and may have distinct ranges or variances.

From the literature, I’ve found that z-score normalization is commonly used to address such issues. However, I’m concerned that applying z-score normalization to each dataset individually might make it impossible to compare across datasets, especially when I want to analyze multiple sessions or subjects later.

Is z-score normalization the right approach in this case? Or would it be better to normalize using a common reference (e.g., using statistics from a larger dataset)?

I’d love to get your perspective on my situation.

# My Background

I’m a Brazilian Mechanical Engineer with 3 years of experience in the Data field—started as a Data Analyst for 1.5 years, then transitioned into Data Engineering. Next week, I’ll be starting as a Data Architect at a multinational with 100,000+ employees, mainly working with the Azure stack.

# The Plan

My girlfriend and I are planning to move to Australia for about a year to travel and build memories together before settling down (marriage, house, etc.). This new job came unexpectedly, but it offers a good salary (\~$2,000 USD/month).

The idea is to:

* Move to Australia
* Work hard & save around $1,000 USD/month
* Travel as much as possible for \~2 years
* Return and re-enter the data field

# The Challenge

The work visa limitation allows me to stay only 6 months with the same employer, making it tough to get good Data Engineering jobs. So, I plan to work in any job that pays well (fruit picking, hospitality, etc.), and my girlfriend will do the same.

# The Concern

When I return, how hard will it be to get back into the data field after a \~2-year break?

* I’ll have enough savings to stay unemployed for about a year if needed.
* This isn’t all my savings—I have the equivalent of 6 years of salary in reserve.
* I regularly get recruiter messages on LinkedIn.
* I speak Portuguese, English, and Spanish fluently.

Now that I'm in data engineering, I feel like I’m constantly thinking about pipelines, bugs, unexpected data issues, or some tool update I haven’t kept up with. Even on vacation, I catch myself checking Slack or thinking about the next sprint.

1josncc,"Career improves, but projects don't? [discussion]","I started 6 years ago and my career has been on a growing trajectory since.

While this is very nice for me, I can’t say the same about the projects I encounter. What I mean is that I was expecting the engineering soundness of the projects I encounter to grow alongside my seniority in this field.

Instead, I’ve found that regardless of where I end up (the last two companies were data consulting shops), the projects I am assigned to tend to have questionable engineering decisions (often involving an unnecessary use of Spark to move 7 rows of data).

The latest one involves ETL out of MSSQL and into object storage, using a combination of Azure synapse spark notebooks, drag and drop GUI pipelines, absolutely no tests or CICD whatsoever, and debatable modeling once data lands in the lake.

This whole thing scares me quite a lot due to the lack of guardrails, while testing and deployments are done manually. While I'd love to rewrite everything from scratch, my eng lead said since that part it's complete and there isn't a plan to change it in the future, that it's not a priority at all, and I agree with this.

What's your experience in situations like this? How do you juggle the competing priorities (client wanting new things vs. optimizing old stuff etc...)?

1jpdpyh,Facebook Marketing API - Anyone have a successful ETL experience?,"We have a python integration set up where we pull data from Google Ads and Facebook Marketing into our data warehouse. We're pulling data about all 3 hierarchy tiers and some daily metrics:

1. Campaigns (id, name, start time, stop time)
2. Ad Groups/Ad Sets (id, name)
3. Ads (id, name, URL)
4. Metrics (clicks, impressions, spend) for the previous day

For the Google Ads API, you basically send a SQL query and the return time is like a tenth of a second.

For Facebook, we see returns times in the minutes, especially on the Ads piece. Was hoping to get an idea of how others might have successfully set up a process to get this data from Facebook in a more timely fashion, and possibly without hitting the rate limiting threshold.

Not the exact code we're using - I can get it off my work system tomorrow - but the gist:

    from facebook_business.adobjects.adaccount import AdAccount
    from facebook_business.adobjects.campaign import Campaign
    from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import AdSet
    from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import Ad
    from facebook_business.adobjects.adcreative import AdCreative
    campaigns = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_campaigns(
        params={},
        fields=[Campaign.Field.id,Campaign.Field.name,Campaign.Field.start_time,Campaign.Field.stop_time]
    )
    adsets= AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_sets(
        params={},
        fields=[AdSet.Field.id,AdSet.Field.name]
    )
    ads = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ads(
        params={},
        fields=[Ad.Field.id,Ad.Field.name,Ad.Field.creative]
    )
    object_urls = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_creatives(
        params={},

        params={},
        fields=[AdCreative.Field.asset_feed_spec]
    )

We then have to do some joining between ads/object\_urls/asset\_urls to match the Ad with the destination URL if the ad is clicked on.

The performance is so slow, that I hope we are doing it wrong. I was never able to get the batch call to work and I'm not sure how to improve things.

1jossd0,Newbie to DE needs help with the approach to the architecture of a project,"So I was hired as a data analyst a few months ago and I have a background in software development. A few months ago I was moved to a smallish project with the objective of streamlining some administrative tasks that were all calculated ""manually"" with Excel.  By the time, all I had worked with were very basic, low code tools from the Microsoft enviroment: PBI for dashboards, Power Automate, Power Apps for data entry, Sharepoint lists, etc, so that's what I used to set it up. 

The cost for the client is basically nonexistent right now, apart from a couple of PBI licenses. The closest I've done to ETL work has been with power query, if you can even call it that. 

  
Now I'm at a point where it feels like that's not gonna cut it anymore. I'm going to be working with larger volumes of data, with more complex relationships between tables and transformations that need to be done earlier in the process. I could technically keep going with what I have but I want to actually build something durable and move towards actual data engineering, but I don't know where to start with a solution that's cost efficient and well structured. For example, I wanted to move the data from Sharepoint lists to a proper database but then we'd have to pay for multiple premium licenses to be able to connect to them in powerapps. Where do I even start?

I know the very basics of data engineering and I've done a couple of tutorial projects with Snowflake and Databricks as my team seems to want to focus on cloud based solutions.

1jp4f74,Built a visual tool on top of Pandas that runs Python transformations row-by-row - What do you guys think?,"Hey data engineers,

For client implementations I thought it was a pain to write python scripts over and over, so I built a tool on top of Pandas to solve my own frustration and as a personal hobby. The goal was to make it so I didn't have to start from the ground up and rewrite and keep track of each script for each data source I had.

**What I Built:**  
A visual transformation tool with some features I thought might interest this community:

1. **Python execution on a row-by-row basis** \- Write Python once per field, save the mapping, and process. It applies each field's mapping logic to each row and returns the result without loops
2. **Visual logic builder** that generates Python from the drag and drop interface. It can re-parse the python so you can go back and edit form the UI again
3. **AI Co-Pilot** that can write Python logic based on your requirements
4. **No environment setup** \- just upload your data and start transforming
5. **Handles nested JSON** with a simple dot notation for complex structures

Here's a screenshot of the logic builder in action:

I'd love some feedback from people who deal with data transformations regularly. If anyone wants to give it a try feel free to shoot me a message or comment, and I can give you lifetime access if the app is of use. Not trying to sell here, just looking for some feedback and thoughts since I just built it.

**Technical Details:**

* Supports CSV, Excel, and JSON inputs/outputs, concatenating files, header & delimiter selection
* Transformations are saved as editable mapping files
* Handles large datasets by processing chunks in parallel
* Built on Pandas. Supports Pandas and re libraries

1jpkgey,Does anyone feel the DE tools are chaging too fast to track,"TL;DR: a guy feeling stuck in the job and cannot figure out what skills are needed to move to a better position 

I am data engineer at a big 4 firm (may be just a etl developer) in india.

I work with Informatica Power Center, Oracle, Unix on the daily basis. Now, when I tried to switch companies for career boost, I realised nobody uses these tech anymore. 

Everyone uses pyspark for etl.
I though fair enough and started leaning pyspark dataframe api. I am so good with sql, pl/sql and python, so it was easy for me.

Then I came to know learning pyspark is not enough, you need to know databricks, snowflake, dbt kind of tools.

Even before making my mind to decide what to learn, things changed and now airflow/dagster, redshift, delta lake, duckdb. I don't what else is in trend now.

Honestly, It feels a lot, like the world is moving in the fastest pace possible and I cannot even decide what to do.

Every job has different tools, and to do the ""fake it till you make it"", I am afraid they would ask any niche question about the tool to which you can only answer if you have the experience.

My profile  is not even getting picked and I feel stuck in the job I am doing.

I am great at what I do, that is one reason the project is not letting me leave even after all the senior folks has left for better projects. The guy with 3 years of experience is the senior most developer and lead now.

But honestly, I dont think I can make it anymore.

If I was just stuck with something like SAP ABAP, frontend or core python, things might have been good. Recruiters will at least look at your profile even though you are not a perfect match as you can learn the rest to do the job. (I might be wrong in this thought)

But for DE roles, the job descriptions are becoming too specific to a tool and people are expecting complete data architect level of skills at 3 years.

1jpxfch,"New to Data Engineering — Feeling a Bit Overwhelmed, Looking for Advice","Hey everyone, I could really use some advice from fellow engineers. I'm pretty new to the data world — I messed up uni, then did an online analytics course, and after about a year and a half of grinding, I finally landed my first role. Along the way, I found a real passion for Python and SQL.

My first job involved a ton of patchy reporting because of messy infra and data. I started automating painful tasks using basic ETL pipelines I built myself. I showed an interest in APIs and, out of nowhere, 6 months in, I was offered a data engineering role.

Fast forward to now — I’ve been in the new role for a month, and I’m the company’s only data engineer. I’m doing a data engineering apprenticeship at the same time, which helps, but the imposter syndrome is real. The company’s been limping along with a 25-year-old piece of software that populates our SQL Server DB, and we’re now migrating to something new. I’ve been asked to learn MuleSoft for ETL and replace some existing pipelines that were built in Python.

I love the subject — I’m genuinely passionate about programming and networking — and I’m keen to take on new tech, improve the infra, and build up strong skills. But I’m not sure if I’m going too deep too fast. For example, today I was learning Docker to deploy Python scripts, just to avoid issues with hundreds of brittle batch files that break if we update Python.

My boss seems to think MuleSoft will fully replace Python, but I see it more as a tool that complements certain workflows rather than a full replacement. What worries me more is that I don’t really have any technical peers. Most people in my team only know basic SQL, and it’s hard to communicate strategy or get proper feedback.

My current priorities are getting comfortable with MuleSoft, Git, and Docker. I’m constantly learning, but sometimes I leave work feeling overwhelmed. There’s so much broken or duct-taped together, I don’t even know where to start. I keep telling myself I don’t need to “save the world,” but I really want to do a good job and come away with solid experience.

Long term, they want to deploy this new software, rebuild the database, and eventually use AI to help employees query the business. There’s a shit ton to do, and I’m still figuring out basics — like setting up a VM just so I can run Docker.

Am I jumping the gun with how I’m feeling, or is this as wild a situation as it seems?

1jplvx0,Suggestions for workflow automation,"Hey there :)

  
I hope I find myself in the right subreddit for this as I am trying to **engineer** my computer to push around some **data** ;) 

I'm currently working on a project to fully automate the processing of test results for a scientific study with students. 

The workflow consists of several stages:

1. **Data Extraction:** The test data is extracted from a local SQL database.
2. **SPSS Processing:** The extracted data is then processed using SPSS with a custom-built syntax (legacy). This step generates multiple files from the data. I have been looking into how I can transition this syntax to a python script, so this step might be cut later.
3. **Python Automation:** A Python script takes over the further processing. It reads the files, splits the data per class, inserts it into pre-designed Excel reporting templates.
4. **File Upload:** The files are then automatically uploaded to a self-hosted Nextcloud instance.
5. **Notification:** Once the workflow is complete, a notification  

I have been thinking about different ways to implement this. Right now the inputs and outputs for the different steps are still done manually. 

At work I have been using Jenkins lately and I think it feels natural  to do it in Jenkins and just describe the whole workflow in a pipeline with different stages to run. Besides that I have some experience with AWS Lambda and n8n but I am not sure if they would be helpful with this task.

I´m not that experienced setting up such workflows as my work background is more in Infosec, so please forgive my uneducated guesses about how I best go about this :D Just trying not to take decisions that will be problematic later.

1jpdpyh,Facebook Marketing API - Anyone have a successful ETL experience?,"We have a python integration set up where we pull data from Google Ads and Facebook Marketing into our data warehouse. We're pulling data about all 3 hierarchy tiers and some daily metrics:

1. Campaigns (id, name, start time, stop time)
2. Ad Groups/Ad Sets (id, name)
3. Ads (id, name, URL)
4. Metrics (clicks, impressions, spend) for the previous day

For the Google Ads API, you basically send a SQL query and the return time is like a tenth of a second.

For Facebook, we see returns times in the minutes, especially on the Ads piece. Was hoping to get an idea of how others might have successfully set up a process to get this data from Facebook in a more timely fashion, and possibly without hitting the rate limiting threshold.

Not the exact code we're using - I can get it off my work system tomorrow - but the gist:

    from facebook_business.adobjects.adaccount import AdAccount
    from facebook_business.adobjects.campaign import Campaign
    from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import AdSet
    from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import Ad
    from facebook_business.adobjects.adcreative import AdCreative
    campaigns = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_campaigns(
        params={},
        fields=[Campaign.Field.id,Campaign.Field.name,Campaign.Field.start_time,Campaign.Field.stop_time]
    )
    adsets= AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_sets(
        params={},
        fields=[AdSet.Field.id,AdSet.Field.name]
    )
    ads = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ads(
        params={},
        fields=[Ad.Field.id,Ad.Field.name,Ad.Field.creative]
    )
    object_urls = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_creatives(
        params={},
        fields=[AdCreative.Field.object_story_spec]
    )
    asset_urls = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_creatives(
        params={},
        fields=[AdCreative.Field.asset_feed_spec]
    )

We then have to do some joining between ads/object\_urls/asset\_urls to match the Ad with the destination URL if the ad is clicked on.

The performance is so slow, that I hope we are doing it wrong. I was never able to get the batch call to work and I'm not sure how to improve things.

The kind of work they assign me to is fairly basic - developing pipelines using Informatica and writing SQL queries for it. That's been majority of my experience. For the past # months, I've been assigned to a PowerBI developer role, but I just tweak the data/queries to do what the client asks. When I try to apply for data engineering/etl roles, I get asked what I think are pretty advanced questions - for example I got asked about what gaps I have noticed in Microsoft Fabric and what are best practices for data modeling etc. I tend to give general answera based on my research and theoretical answers, but I can never relate it to my actual experience because day to day I don't do anything high level. I get asked about how I optimzied queries or pipelines, the truth is I worked with small enough datasets that I never really had to do anything.

1jpn1do,Help a noob understand whether this is feasible,"Hey all,
I’m working on a project that involves building a comprehensive overview of all therapist-related businesses in my country. I’ve found a public online source that lists approximately 16,000 such businesses, spread across many paginated result pages.

Each entry links to a detail page with information such as:

Business name
Business owner (person or legal entity)
Registration number (similar to a company ID)
Location (optional)
No consistent link to a website, but it's often listed in the details

What I need help with:

(1) Scrape all business data into a structured list (CSV, JSON or database).
This involves crawling through all paginated pages and collecting each business profile’s content.

(2) Automatically search for a homepage/website for each business.
The source doesn't always list websites, so for those missing, I'd like to auto-search Google (or use a business API if necessary) to find the most likely company homepage.
(3) If a homepage is found: scrape relevant data from the website itself.

Goal:
To build a clean, filterable dataset that can be used for matching clients with therapists (via a separate platform I'm developing).

Questions I’d like help with:

Is this technically feasible using open tools or affordable APIs? What/who exactly would I be looking for? I have tried navigating Fiverr, but I am simply not sure what I need to be frank...

I'm a solo data consultant and over the past few years, I’ve been helping companies in Europe build their data stacks.

I noticed I was repeatedly performing the same tasks across my projects: setting up dbt, configuring Snowflake, and, more recently, migrating to Iceberg data lakes.

So I've been working on a solution for the past few months called [**Boring Data**](http://boringdata.io).

It's a set of Terraform templates ready to be deployed in AWS and/or Snowflake with pre-built integrations for ELT tools and orchestrators.

I think these templates are a great fit for many projects:

* Pay once, own it forever
* Get started fast
* Full control

I'd love to get feedback on this approach, which isn't very common (from what I've seen) in the data industry.

Is Terraform commonly used on your teams, or is that a barrier to using templates like these?

1jpj0a0,Is my career choice taking me away from Data engineering jobs ?,"Hello everyone,

First of all English is not my first language so I apologize if there are mistakes or if everything is not clear.

I've been working for 6 years and my career path is not very consistent.  
I started in non-technical positions for 3 years and then moved on to a more technical one. 

For 3 years I had a very diversified job with software development (Php, Python), database management, Linux system administration, a bit of Cloud and a big part of “Data” with ETL flows (Talend) and a lot of SQL. The project was quite large and the team very small, so I was working on several tasks at once.

I really enjoyed the Data part and I got it into my head that I wanted to be a 'real' Data Engineer and not just drag and drop on Talend.

I was just starting my research when a friend of mine contacted me because a software engineer position was opening up in his company. I went through the recruitment process and accepted their proposal.

  
As in my previous position, I'll be working on a lot of things (mobile development, backend, a bit of frontend, cloud, devops) and the salary offered was 20% higher than what I had in my previous job. (I'm now at 48k€ and I don't live in a big city).  
The offer was really attractive and as the market is a bit complicated at the moment, I accepted.

But I'm wondering if this choice will take me even further away from the Data Engineer job i wanted.

Do you find my career path coherent?  
Could I switch back to Data in a few years' time?

1jpqnx3,I Want To Improve an Internal Process At My Company,"Hey r/dataengineering,

I'm currently transitioning from a software engineering role to data engineering, and I've identified a potential project at my company that I think would be a great learning experience and a chance to introduce some data engineering best practices.

Project Overview:

We have a dashboard that displays employee utilization data, sourced from two main systems: Harvest (time tracking) and Forecast (projected utilization).

Current Process:

* Harvest Data: Currently, we're using cron jobs running on an EC2 instance to periodically pull data from Harvest.
* Forecast Data: Due to the lack of an API, we're relying on Playwright (web scraping) to extract data from their web reports, which are then saved to S3.
* Data Processing: Another cron job on EC2 processes the S3 reports and loads the data into a PostgreSQL database.
* Dashboard: A custom frontend application (using Azure OAuth) queries the PostgreSQL database to display the utilization data.

Proposed Solution:

I'm proposing a serverless architecture on AWS, using the following components:

* API Gateway + Lambda: To create a robust API for our frontend application.
* Lambda for ETL: To automate data extraction, transformation, and loading from Harvest and Forecast.
* AWS Step Functions: To orchestrate the data pipeline and manage dependencies.
* Amazon RDS PostgreSQL: To serve as our data warehouse for analytical queries.
* API Gateway Authorizer: To integrate Azure OAuth authentication.
* CI/CD with CodePipeline and CodeBuild: To automate testing and deployment.
* Docker and SAM CLI: For local development and testing.

My Goals:

* Gain hands-on experience with AWS serverless technologies.
* Implement data engineering best practices for ETL and data warehousing.
* Improve the reliability and scalability of our data pipeline.
* Potentially expand this architecture to serve as a central data warehouse for other company analytical data.

My Questions:

1. For those with experience in similar projects, what are some key considerations or potential challenges I should be aware of?
2. Any advice on best practices for designing and implementing a serverless data pipeline on AWS?
3. Are there any specific AWS services or tools that you would recommend for this project?
4. How would you recommend getting started on a project like this, what would you focus on first?
5. What would be some good ways to test this type of system?

I'm eager to learn and contribute, and I appreciate any insights or advice you can offer.

- pipelines and infra manages itself with much higher accuracy and less misconfigurations

1jr15ej,What's the non-technical biggest barrier you face at work?,"What’s currently challenging for me is getting access to things.

I design a data pipeline, present it to the team that will benefit from it, and everyone gets super excited.

Then I reach out to the internal department or an external party to either grant me admin access to the platform I need, or to help me obtain an API.

A week goes by—nothing. I follow up via email. Eventually, someone replies and says it's not possible to give me admin credentials. Fine. So I ask, “Can you help me get the API instead? It’s very straightforward.”

Another week goes by—still nothing. I send another follow-up…

Now the other person is kind of frustrated (because I’m asking them to do something slightly different, even though I’m offering guidance).

What follows is just a back-and-forth with long, frustrating waiting periods in between. Meanwhile, the team I presented the pipeline or project to starts getting frustrated with me and probably thinks I’m full of crap.

Once I finally get the damn API or whatever access I needed, I complete the project in 1–2 days but delayed by weeks or even months.

1jr3z1u,Faster way to view + debug data,"Hi r/dataengineering!

  
I wanted to share a project that I have been working on. It's an intuitive data editor where you can interact with local and remote data (e.g. Athena & BigQuery). For several important tasks, it can speed you up by 10x or more. (see website for more)

  
For data engineering specifically, this would be really useful in debugging pipelines, cleaning local or remote data, and being able to easy create new tables within data warehouses etc.

I know this could be a lot faster than having to type everything out, especially if you're just poking around. I personally find myself using this before trying any manual work.

Also, for those doing complex queries, you can split them up and work with the frame visually and add queries when needed. Super useful for when you want to iteratively build an analysis or new frame ***without writing a super long query.***

  
As for data size, it can handle local data up to around 1B rows, and remote data is only limited by your data warehouse.

  
You don't have to migrate *anything* either.

  
If you're interested, you can check it out here: [https://www.cocoalemana.com](https://www.cocoalemana.com)

  
I'd love to hear about your workflow, and see what we can change to make it cover more data engineering use cases.

  
Cheers!

1jr23mk,How do I get out of this rut,"I’m currently about the finish an early career rotational program with a top 10 bank. The rotation I am currently on and where the company is placing me post program (I tried to get placed somewhere else) is as a data engineer on a data delivery team. When I was advertised this rotation and the team I was told pretty specifically we would be using all the relevant technologies and I would be very hands on keyboard building pipelines with python , configuring cloud services and snowflake, being a part of data modeling. Mind you I’m not completely new I have experience with all this in personal projects and previous work experience as a SWE and researcher in college. 

Turns out all of that was a lie. I later learned there is an army of contractors that do the actual work. I was stuck with analyzing .egp files and other SAS files documenting it and handing off to consultants to rebuild in Talend to ingest into snowflake. The only tech that I use is Visio and Word.

I coped with that by saying after I’m out of the program I’ll get to do the actual work. But I had a conversation with my manager today about what my role will be post program. He basically said there are a lot more of these SAS procedures they are porting over to talend and snowflake and I’ll be documenting them and handing over to contractors so they can implement the new process. Honestly that is all really quick and easy to do because there isn’t that much complicated business logic for the LOBs we support just joins and the occasional aggregation so most days I’m not doing anything.

When I told him I would really like to be involved in the technical work or the data modeling , he said that is not my job anymore and that is what we pay the contractors to do so I can’t do it. Almost made it seem like I should be grateful and he is doing me a favor somehow.

It just feels like I was misled or even outright lied to about the position. We don’t use any of the technologies that were advertised (Drag and drop/low code tools seem like fake engineering), I don’t get to be hands on keyboard at all. Just seems like there really I no growth or opportunity in this role. I would leave but I took relocation and a signing bonus for this and if I leave too early I owe it back. I also can’t internally transfer anywhere for a year after starting my new role.

I guess my rant is just to ask what should I be doing in this situation? I work on personal projects and open source and I have gotten a few certs in the downtime at work but I don’t know if it’s enough to make sure my skills don’t atrophy while I wait out my repayment period. I consider myself a somewhat technical guy but I have been boxed into a non technical role.

1jramqt,"Airbyte Connector Builder now supports GraphQL, Async Requests and Custom Components","Hello, Marcos from the Airbyte Team.

For those who may not be familiar, Airbyte is an open-source data integration (EL) platform with over 500 connectors for APIs, databases, and file storage.

In our last release we added several new features to our no-code Connector Builder:

* [GraphQL Support](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/request-options#graphql-request-injection): In addition to REST, you can now make requests to GraphQL APIs (and properly handle pagination!)
* [Async Data Requests](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/connector-builder-ui/async-streams): There are some reporting APIs that do not return responses immediately. For instance, with Google Ads.  You can now request a custom report from these sources and wait for the report to be processed and downloaded.
* [Custom Python Code Components](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/connector-builder-ui/custom-components): We recognize that some APIs behave uniquely—for example, by returning records as key-value pairs instead of arrays or by not ordering data correctly. To address these cases, our open-source platform now supports custom Python components that extend the capabilities of the no-code framework without blocking you from building your connector.

We believe these updates will make connector development faster and more accessible, helping you get the most out of your data integration projects.

We understand there are discussions about the trade-offs between no-code and low-code solutions. At Airbyte, transitioning from fully coded connectors to a low-code approach allowed us to maintain a large connector catalog using standard components.  We were also able to create a better build and test process directly in the UI. Users frequently give us the feedback that the no-code connector Builder enables less technical users to create and ship connectors. This reduces the workload on senior data engineers allowing them to focus on critical data pipelines.

Something else that has been top of mind is speed and performance. With a robust and stable connector framework, the engineering team has been dedicating significant resources to introduce concurrency to enhance sync speed. You can read this[ blog post](https://airbyte.com/blog/improving-connector-sync-speed-up-to-10x-faster) about how the team implemented concurrency in the Klaviyo connector, resulting in a speed increase of about 10x for syncs.

I hope you like the news! Let me know if you want to discuss any missing features or provide feedback about Airbyte.",3,2,marcos_airbyte,2025-04-04 12:26:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jramqt/airbyte_connector_builder_now_supports_graphql/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-04 12:26:58,12,Friday,351.0,2602,39.23,23,626,12.1,1,1

1jrd8po,PII Obfuscation in Databricks,"Hi Data Champs,

I have been recently given chance to explore PII obfuscation technique in databricks.

I proposed using sql aes_encryption or python fernet for PII column level encryption before landing to bronze.

And use column masking on delta tables which has built in logic for group membership check and decryption so to avoid the overhead of a new view per table.

My HDE was more interested in sql approach than the fernet but fernet offers built in key rotation out of the box.

Has anyone used aes_encryption 
Is it secure, easy to work with and relatively more robust.

From my experience for data type other than binary like long, int, double it needs to be first converted to binary (don’t like it)

Apart from that usual error here and there for padding and generic error when decrypting sometimes.

as always that's for the insight from other people, I find a lot of these discussions around points very entertaining and very helpful!

I'm having an argument with someone who is several levels above me. This might sound petty so I apologise in advance. It centres around the definition of a Mart. Our Mart is a single Fact with around 20 dimensions. The Fact is extremely wide and deep. Indeed we usually put it into a de normalised table for reporting. To me this isn't a MART as it isn't based on requirements but rather a star schema that supposedly servers multiple purposed or potential purposes. When engaged on requirements the person leans on there experience in the domain and says a user probable wants to do X, Y and Z. I've never seen anything written down. Constantly that report also defers to Kimball methodology and how this follows them closely. My take on the book is that these things need to be based of requirement, business requirements. 

My questions is, is it fair to say that a data mart needs to have requirements and ideally a business domain in mind or else its just a star schema?

Yes this  is  very theoretical... yes I probable need a hobby but look there hasn't been a decent RTS game in years and its friday!!!

1jrd286,Just wanted to share a recent win that made our whole team feel pretty good.,"We worked with this e-commerce client last month (kitchen products company, can't name names) who was dealing with data chaos.

When they came to us, their situation was rough. Dashboards taking forever to load, some poor analyst manually combining data from 5 different sources, and their CEO breathing down everyone's neck for daily conversion reports. Classic spreadsheet hell that we've all seen before.

We spent about two weeks redesigning their entire data architecture. Built them a proper [**data warehouse solution** ](https://datafortune.com/services/enterprise-data-management/data-warehouse/)with automated ETL pipelines that consolidated everything into one central location. Created some logical data models and connected it all to their existing BI tools.

The transformation was honestly pretty incredible to watch. Reports that used to take hours now run in seconds. Their analyst actually took a vacation for the first time in a year.

1ju81cr,Jira: Is it still helping teams... or just slowing them down?,"I’ve been part of (and led) a teams over the last decade — in enterprises

And one tool keeps showing up everywhere: **Jira**.

It’s the ""default"" for a lot of engineering orgs. Everyone knows it. Everyone uses it.  
But **I don’t seen anyone who actually likes it.**

Not in the *""ugh it's corporate but fine""* way — I mean people who are actively frustrated by it but still use it daily.

Here are some of the most common friction points I’ve either experienced or heard from other devs/product folks:

1. **Custom workflows spiral out of control** — What starts as ""just a few tweaks"" becomes an unmanageable mess.
2. **Slow performance** — Large projects? Boards crawling? Yup.
3. **Search that requires sorcery** — Good luck finding an old ticket without a detailed Jira PhD.
4. **New team members struggle to onboard** — It’s not exactly intuitive.
5. **The “tool tax”** — Teams spend hours updating Jira instead of moving work forward.

And yet... most teams stick with it. Because switching is painful. Because “at least everyone knows Jira.” Because the alternative is more uncertainty.

1jusby0,Best way to handle loading JSON API data into database in pipelines,"Greetings, this is my first post here. I've been working in DE for the last 5 years now doing various things with Airflow and Dagster.  I have a question regarding design of data flow from APIs to our database.

I am using Dagster/Python to perform the API pulls and loads into Snowflake.

My team lead insists that we load JSON data into our Snowflake RAW\_DATA in the following way:

ID (should be a surrogate/non-native PK)  
PAYLOAD (raw JSON payload, either as a VARCHAR or VARIANT type)  
CREATED\_DATE (timestamp this row was created in Snowflake)  
UPDATE\_DATE (timestamp this row was updated in Snowflake)

Flattening of the payload then happens in SQL as a plain View, which we currently autogenerate using Python and manually edit and add to Snowflake.

He does not want us (DE team) to use DBT to do any transforming of RAW\_DATA. DBT is only for the Data Analyst team to use for creating models.

The main advantage I see to this approach is flexibility if the JSON schema changes. You can freely append/drop/insert/reorder/rename columns. whereas a normal table you can only drop, append, and rename.

On the downside, it is slow and clunky to parse with SQL and access the data as a view. It just seems inefficient to have to recompute the view and parse all those JSON payloads whenever you want to access the table.  
  
I'd much rather do the flattening in Python, either manually or using dlt. Some JSON payloads I 'pre-flatten' in Python to make them easier to parse in SQL.

Is there a better way, or is this how you all handle this as well?",6,1,fetus-flipper,2025-04-08 23:56:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jusby0/best_way_to_handle_loading_json_api_data_into/,0,False,2025-04-09 00:01:00,False,False,2025-04-08 23:56:12,23,Tuesday,272.0,1563,70.02,15,390,10.9,0,0

1jujn9j,Lessons from optimizing dashboard performance on Looker Studio with BigQuery data,"We’ve been using Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio) to build reporting dashboards for digital marketing and SEO data. At first, things worked fine—but as datasets grew, dashboard performance dropped significantly.



The biggest bottlenecks were:

• Overuse of blended data sources

• Direct querying of large GA4 datasets

• Too many calculated fields applied in the visualization layer



To fix this, we adjusted our approach on the data engineering side:

• Moved most calculations (e.g., conversion rates, ROAS) to the query layer in BigQuery

• Created materialized views for campaign-level summaries

• Used scheduled queries to pre-aggregate weekly and monthly data

• Limited Looker Studio to one direct connector per dashboard and cached data where possible



Result: dashboards now load in \~3 seconds instead of 15–20, and we can scale them across accounts with minimal changes.

1juhrrs,Help: Looking to set up a decent data architecture (data lake and/or warehouse),"Hi, I need help. I need a proper architecture for a department, and I am trying to get a data lake/warehouse.

Why: We have a lot of data sources from SaaS to manually created documents. We use a lot of SaaS products, but we have no centralised repository to store and stage the data, so we end up with a lot of workaround such as using SharePoint and csv stored in folders for reporting. We also change SaaS products quite frequently, so sources can change often. It is difficult to do advanced analytics. 

I prefer a lake & warehouse approach because (1) for SaaS users, they can can just drop the data to the lake and (2) transformation and processing can be done for reporting, and we could combine the datasets even when we change the SaaS software. 

My huge considerations are that (1) the data is to be accessible within the department only and (2) it has to be decent cost. Currently considered Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 & DataBricks, or Snowflake (to have both the lake and warehouse). My previous experience was only with Data Lake Storage Gen2.

I'm willing to work my way up for my technical limitations, but at this stage I am exploring the software solutions to get the buy in to kickstart this project.

1juvakz,Beginner Predictive Model Feedback/Guidance,"My predictive modeling folks, beginner here could use some feedback guidance. Go easy on me, this is my first machine learning/predictive model project and I had very basic python experience before this.


I’ve been working on a personal project building a model that predicts NFL player performance using full career, game-by-game data for any offensive player who logged a snap between 2017–2024. 

I trained the model using data through 2023 with XGBoost Regressor, and then used actual 2024 matchups — including player demographics (age, team, position, depth chart) and opponent defensive stats (Pass YPG, Rush YPG, Points Allowed, etc.) — as inputs to predict game-level performance in 2024.

The model performs really well for some stats (e.g., R² > 0.875 for Completions, Pass Attempts, CMP%, Pass Yards, and Passer Rating), but others — like Touchdowns, Fumbles, or Yards per Target — aren’t as strong.

Here’s where I need input:

-What’s a solid baseline R², RMSE, and MAE to aim for — and does that benchmark shift depending on the industry?

-Could trying other models/a combination of models improve the weaker stats? Should I use different models for different stat categories (e.g., XGBoost for high-R² ones, something else for low-R²)?

-How do you typically decide which model is the best fit? Trial and error? Is there a structured way to choose based on the stat being predicted?

-I used XGBRegressor based on common recommendations — are there variants of XGBoost or alternatives you'd suggest trying? Any others you like better?

-Are these considered “good” model results for sports data?

-Are sports models generally harder to predict than industries like retail, finance, or real estate?

-What should my next step be if I want to make this model more complete and reliable (more accurate) across all stat types?

-How do people generally feel about manually adding in more intangible stats to tweak data and model performance? Example: Adding an injury index/strength multiplier for a Defense that has a lot of injuries, or more player’s coming back from injury, etc.? Is this a generally accepted method or not really utilized?

1judm9f,GizmoSQL: Power your Enterprise analytics with Arrow Flight SQL and DuckDB,"Hi! This is Phil - Founder of [GizmoData](https://gizmodata.com). We have a new commercial database engine product called: [GizmoSQL](https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql) \- built with Apache Arrow Flight SQL (for remote connectivity) and DuckDB (or optionally: SQLite) as a back-end execution engine.

This product allows you to run DuckDB or SQLite as a server (remotely) - harnessing the power of computers in the cloud - which typically have more CPUs, more memory, and faster storage (NVMe) than your laptop. In fact, running GizmoSQL on a modern arm64-based VM in Azure, GCP, or AWS allows you to run at terabyte scale - with equivalent (or better) performance - for a fraction of the cost of other popular platforms such as Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks SQL.

**GizmoSQL** is self-hosted (for now) - with a possible SaaS offering in the near future. It has these features to differentiate it from ""base"" DuckDB:

* Run DuckDB or SQLite as a server (remote connectivity)
* Concurrency - allows multiple users to work simultaneously - with independent, ACID-compliant sessions
* Security
   * Authentication
   * TLS for encryption of traffic to/from the database
* Static executable with Arrow Flight SQL, DuckDB, SQLite, and JWT-CPP built-in. There are no dependencies to install - just a single executable file to run
* Free for use in development, evaluation, and testing
* Easily containerized for running in the Cloud - especially in Kubernetes
* Easy to talk to - with ADBC, JDBC, and ODBC drivers, and now a Websocket proxy server (created by GizmoData) - so it is easy to use with javascript frameworks
   * Use it with Tableau, PowerBI, Apache Superset dashboards, and more
* Easy to work with in Python - use ADBC, or the new experimental Ibis back-end - details here: [https://github.com/gizmodata/ibis-gizmosql](https://github.com/gizmodata/ibis-gizmosql)

Because it is powered by DuckDB - GizmoSQL can work with the popular open-source data formats - such as Iceberg, Delta Lake, Parquet, and more.

GizmoSQL performs very well (when running DuckDB as its back-end execution engine) - check out our graph comparing popular SQL engines for TPC-H at scale-factor 1 Terabyte - on the homepage at: [https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql](https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql) \- there you will find it also costs far less than other options.

We would love to get your feedback on the software - it is easy to get started for free in two different ways:

* For a limited time - try GizmoSQL online on our dime - with the SQL Query Navigator - it just requires a quick registration and sign-in to get going - at: [https://app.gizmodata.com](https://app.gizmodata.com) \- where we have a read-only 1TB TPC-H database mounted for you to query in real-time. It is running on an Azure Cobalt 100 VM - with local NVMe SSD's - so it should be quite zippy.
* Download and self-host GizmoSQL - using our Docker image or executables for Linux and macOS for both x86-64 and arm64 architectures. See our README at: [https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql-public](https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql-public) for details on how to easily and quickly get started that way

Thank you for taking a look at GizmoSQL. We are excited and are glad to answer any questions you may have!

1ju7cmf,What is the best way to reflect data in clickhouse from MySQL other than the MySQL engine?,"Hi everyone, I am working on a project currently where we have a MySQL database. We are using clickhouse as our warehouse. 

What we need to achieve is to reflect the data from MySQL to clickhouse for certain tables. For this, I found a few ways and am looking to get some insights on which method has the most potential and if there are other methods as welp:

1. Use the MySQL engine in clickhouse. 

Pros: No need to store data in clickhouse as it can just proxy it directly from MySQL.

Cons: This however puts extra reads on MySQL and doesn't help us if MySQL ever goes down. 

2. Use signals to send the data to clickhouse whenever there is a change in MySQL.

Pros: We don't have a lot of tables currently so it's the quickest to setup. 

Cons: Extremely inefficient and not scalable. 

3. Use some sort of third party sink to achieve this. I have found this https://github.com/Altinity/clickhouse-sink-connector which seems to do the job but it has way too many open issues and not sure if it is reliable enough. Plus, it complicates our tech stack which we are looking not to do. 

I'm open to any other ideas. We would ideally not want to duplicate this data in clickhouse but if that's the last resort we would go for it. 

Thanks in advance.

1juj0x6,Beginning Data Scientist in Azure needing some help (iot),"Hi all,

I currently am working on a new structure to save sensor data coming from Azure Iot Hub in Azure to store it into Azure Blob Storage for historical data, and Clickhouse for hot data with TTL (around half year). The sensor data is coming from different entities (e.g building1, boat1, boat2) and should be partioned by entity. The data we’re processing daily is around 300-2 million records per day.

I know Azure Iot Hub is essentially a built-in Azure Hub. I had a few questions since I’ve tried multiple solutions. 

1. Normal message routing to Azure Blob
Issue: no custom partitioning on file structure (e.g entityid/timestamp_sensor/) it requires you to use the enqueued time. And there is no dead letter queue for fallback

2. IoT hub -> Azure Functions -> Blob Storage & Clickhouse
Issue: this should work correctly but I have not that much experience in Azure Functions, I tried creating a function with the IoT Hub template but it seems I need to also have an Event Hubs namespace which is not what I want. HTTP trigger is also not what I want. I don’t find any good documentation on it aswell. I know I can maybe use Event Hubs trigger and use the Iot Hub connection string but I didn’t manage to do this yet.

3. IoT hub -> Event Grid 
Someone suggested using Event Grid, however to my knowledge Event Grid is not used for telemetry data despite there being an option for. Is this beneficial? I don’t really know what the flow would be since you can’t use Event Grid to send data to Clickhouse. You would still need an Azure Functions.

4. IoT Hub -> Event Grid -> Event Hubs -> Azure Functions -> Azure Blob & Clickhouse
This one seemed the most appealing to me but I don’t know if it’s the smartest, it can get expensive (maybe).
But the idea here is that we use Event Grid for batching the data and to have a dead letter queue.
Arrived in Event Hubs we use an Azure Function to send the data to blob storage and clickhouse.

The only problem is I might need some delay to sending to Clickhouse & Blob Storage (around maybe every 15 minutes) to reduce the risks of memory usage in Clickhouse and to reduce costs.

Can someone help me out? Am I forgetting something crucial? I am a graduated data scientist, however I have no in depth experience with Azure.

1jxtxqo,How do my fellow on-prem DEs keep their sanity...,"...the joys of memory and compute resources seems to be a neverending suck 😭

We're building ETL pipelines, using Airflow in one K8s namespace and Spark in another (the latter having dedicated hardware). Most data workloads aren't really Spark-worthy as files are typically <20GB, and we keep hitting pain points where processes struggle in Airflow's memory (workers are 6Gi and 6 CPU, with a limit of 10GI; no KEDA or HPA). We are looking into more efficient data structures like DuckDB, Polars, etc or running ""mid-tier"" processes as separate K8s jobs but then we hit constraints like tools/libraries relying on Pandas use so we seem stuck with eager processes.

Case in point, I just learned that our teams are having to split files into smaller files of 125k records so Pydantic schema validation won't fail on memory. I looked into GX Core and see the main source options there again appear to be Pandas or Spark dataframes (yes, I'm going to try DuckDB through SQLAlchemy). I could bite the bullet and just say to go with Spark, but then our pipelines will be using Spark for QA and not for ETL which will be fun to keep clarifying. 

Sisyphus is the patron saint of Data Engineering... just sayin'

I don’t have any indication also of when something is finished. For example, it’s highly possible to have 100 files that would end up being 100% of my daily table, but I receive them scattered over 15min-30 when the data become available and my ingestion process ingest it. Can be 1 to 12 hours after the day is over.

Not that’s it’s also possible to have 10000 very small files per day.

I’m wondering how is this solves with Iceberg tables. Very newbie Iceberg guy here. Like I don’t see throughput write benchmark anywhere but I figure that rewriting the metadata files must be a big overhead if there’s a very large amount of files so inserting every times there’s a new one must not be the ideal solution.

I’ve read some medium post saying that there was a snapshot feature which track new files so you don’t have to do some fancy things to load them incrementally. But again if every insert is a query that change the metadata files it must be bad at some point.

Do you wait and usually build a process to store a list of files before inserting them or is this a feature build somewhere already in a doc I can’t find ?

Any help would be appreciated.

1jxswyj,Dilemma: SWE vs DE @ Big Tech,"I currently work at a Big Tech and have 3 YoE. My role is a mix of Full-Stack + Data Engineering. 

I want to keep preparing for interviews on the side, and to do that I need to know which role to aim for. 

Pros of SWE:
- more jobs positions 
- I have already invested 300 hours into DSA Leetcode. Don’t have to start DE prep from scratch
-Maybe better quality of work/pay(?)

Pros of DE:
- targeting a niche has always given me more callbacks
- if I practice a lot of sql, the interviews at FAANG could be gamed. FAANG do ask DSA but they barely scratch the surface

My thoughts:
Ideally I want to crack the SWE role at a FAANG as I like both roles equally but SWE pays 20% more. If I don’t get callbacks for SWE, then securing a similar pay through a DE role at FAANG is lucrative too. 
I’d be completely fine with doing DE, but I feel uneasy wasting the 100s of hours I spent on DSA. 

Applying for both jobs is sub optimal as I can only sink my time into SQL or DSA | system design or data modelling.

1jxtvbu,Thoughts on Acryl vs other metadata platforms,"Hi all, I'm evaluating metadata management solutions for our data platform and would appreciate any thoughts from folks who've actually implemented these tools in production.

We're currently running into scaling issues with our in-house data catalog and I think we need something more robust for governance and lineage tracking.

I've narrowed it down to Acryl (DataHub) and Collate (openmetadata) as the main contenders. I know I should look at Collibra and Alation and maybe Unity Catalog?

For context, we're a mid-sized fintech (\~500 employees) with about 30 data engineers and scientists. We're AWS with Snowflake, Airflow for orchestration, and a growing number of ML models in production.

My question list is: 

1. How these tools handle machine-scale operations 
2. How painful was it to get set up?
3. For DataHub and openmetadata specifically - is the open source version viable or is the cloud version necessary?
4. Any unexpected limitations you've hit with any of these platforms?
5. Do you feel like these grow with you as we increasingly head into AI governance? 
6. How well they integrate with existing tools (Snowflake, dbt, Looker, etc.)

1jxtxqo,How do my fellow on-prem DEs keep their sanity...,"...the joys of memory and compute resources seems to be a neverending suck 😭

We're building ETL pipelines, using Airflow in one K8s namespace and Spark in another (the latter having dedicated hardware). Most data workloads aren't really Spark-worthy as files are typically <20GB, and we keep hitting pain points where processes struggle in Airflow's memory (workers are 6Gi and 6 CPU, with a limit of 10GI; no KEDA or HPA). We are looking into more efficient data structures like DuckDB, Polars, etc or running ""mid-tier"" processes as separate K8s jobs but then we hit constraints like tools/libraries relying on Pandas use so we seem stuck with eager processes.

Case in point, I just learned that our teams are having to split files into smaller files of 125k records so Pydantic schema validation won't fail on memory. I looked into GX Core and see the main source options there again appear to be Pandas or Spark dataframes (yes, I'm going to try DuckDB through SQLAlchemy). I could bite the bullet and just say to go with Spark, but then our pipelines will be using Spark for QA and not for ETL which will be fun to keep clarifying.

1jxun0q,Data Inserts best practices with Iceberg,"I receive various files at different intervals which are not defined. Can be every seconds, hour, daily, etc.

I don’t have any indication also of when something is finished. For example, it’s highly possible to have 100 files that would end up being 100% of my daily table, but I receive them scattered over 15min-30 when the data become available and my ingestion process ingest it. Can be 1 to 12 hours after the day is over.

Not that’s it’s also possible to have 10000 very small files per day.

I’m wondering how is this solves with Iceberg tables. Very newbie Iceberg guy here. Like I don’t see throughput write benchmark anywhere but I figure that rewriting the metadata files must be a big overhead if there’s a very large amount of files so inserting every times there’s a new one must not be the ideal solution.

I’ve read some medium post saying that there was a snapshot feature which track new files so you don’t have to do some fancy things to load them incrementally. But again if every insert is a query that change the metadata files it must be bad at some point.

Do you wait and usually build a process to store a list of files before inserting them or is this a feature build somewhere already in a doc I can’t find ?

Any help would be appreciated.

1jy9eh1,Data modeling for analytics with legacy Schema-on-Read data lake?,"Most guides on data modeling and data pipelines seem to focus on greenfield projects.

But how do you deal with a legacy data lake where there's been years of data written into tables with no changes to original source-defined schemas?

I have hundreds of table schemas which analysts want to use but can't because they have to manually go through the data catalogue and find every column containing 'x' data or simply not bothering with some tables.

How do you tackle such a legacy mess of data? Say I want to create a Kimball model that models a persons fact table as the grain, and dimensions tables for biographical and employment data. Is my only choice to just manually inspect all the different tables to find which have the kind of column I need? Note here that there wasn't even a basic normalisation of column names enforced (""phone_num"", ""phone"", ""tel"", ""phone_number"" etc) and some of this data is already in OBT form with some containing up to a hundred sparsely populated columns.

Do I apply fuzzy matching to identify source columns? Use an LLM to build massive mapping dictionaries? What are some approaches or methods I should consider when tackling this so I'm not stuck scrolling through infinite print outs? There is a metadata catalogue with some columns having been given tags to identify its content, but these aren't consistent and also have high cardinality.

From the business perspective, they want completeness, so I can't strategically pick which tables to use and ignore the rest. Is there a way I should prioritize based on integrating the largest datasets first?

1jy7sii,Building a Real-Time Analytics Pipeline: Balancing Throughput and Latency,"Hey everyone,

I'm designing a system to process and analyze a continuous stream of data with a focus on both high throughput and low latency. I wanted to share my proposed architecture and get your insights.

1. The core components are: **Kafka:** Serving as the central nervous system for ingesting a massive amount of data reliably.
2. **Go Processor:** A consumer application written in Go, placed directly after Kafka, to perform initial, low-latency processing and filtering of the incoming data.
3. **Intermediate Queue (Redis Streams/NATS JetStream):** To decouple the low-latency processing from the potentially slower analytics and to provide buffering for data that needs further analysis.
4. **Analytics Consumer:** Responsible for the more intensive analytical tasks on the filtered data from the queue.
5. **WebSockets:** For pushing the processed insights to a frontend in real-time.

The idea is to leverage Kafka's throughput capabilities while using Go for quick initial processing. The queue acts as a buffer and allows us to be selective about the data sent for deeper analytics. Finally, WebSockets provide the real-time link to the user.

I built this keeping in mind these three principles

* **Separation of Concerns:** Each component has a specific responsibility.
* **Scalability:** Kafka handles ingestion, and individual consumers can be scaled independently.
* **Resilience:** The queue helps decouple processing stages.

Has anyone implemented a similar architecture? What were some of the challenges and lessons learned? Any recommendations for improvements or alternative approaches?

Hello all! I'm excited to dive into **ADF** and try out some new things.

Here, you can see we have a copy data activity that transfers files from the source ADLS to the raw ADLS location. Then, we have a Lookup named **Lkp\_archivepath** which retrieves values from the SQL server, known as the Metastore. This will get values such as **archive\_path** and **archive\_delete\_flag** (typically it will be Y or N, and sometimes the parameter will be missing as well). After that, we have a copy activity that copies files from the source ADLS to the archive location. Now, I'm encountering an issue as I'm trying to introduce this archive delete flag concept.

If the **archive\_delete\_flag** is '**Y**', it should not delete the files from the source, but it should delete the files if the **archive\_delete\_flag** is '**N**', '' or NULL, depending on the Metastore values. How can I make this work?

Can the above mentioned functions be achieved under 30 secs if they're clubbed into 1 Lambda function?

This is the first thing I am struggling to understand, my second dilemma is about testing jobs locally.  
How does local testing happen?

**->** if we will use glue's compute engine we run into the first question of: gap between code base and single jobs.

**->** if we use open source spark locally:

1. data can be too big to be processed locally, even if we are just testing, and this might be the reason we opted for serverless spark on the first place.

We're currently running into scaling issues with our in-house data catalog and I think we need something more robust for governance and lineage tracking.

I've narrowed it down to Acryl (DataHub) and Collate (openmetadata) as the main contenders. I know I should look at Collibra and Alation and maybe Unity Catalog?

For context, we're a mid-sized fintech (\~500 employees) with about 30 data engineers and scientists. We're AWS with Snowflake, Airflow for orchestration, and a growing number of ML models in production.

My question list is: 

1. How these tools handle machine-scale operations 
2. How painful was it to get set up?
3. For DataHub and openmetadata specifically - is the open source version viable or is the cloud version necessary?
4. Any unexpected limitations you've hit with any of these platforms?
5. Do you feel like these grow with you as we increasingly head into AI governance? 
6. How well they integrate with existing tools (Snowflake, dbt, Looker, etc.)

1. The data extraction is done using a python script using bcp command and pyodbc library 
2. The converted code from snowconvert will be used in a python script again to create all the database objects. 
3. data extracted will be loaded into internal stage and then to table 

2 and 3 will use snowflake’s python connector

1. Use ADF to store pipeline output into an Azure blob container 
2. Use external stage to utilise this blob and load data into table 


1. My question is if you have ADF for transitional data then why not use the same thing for historic data as well (I was given the task of historic data)
2. Is there a free way to handle this transitional data as well. It needs to be enterprise level (Also what is wrong with using VS Code extension) 
3. After I showed initial approach following things were asked by mentor/friend to incorporate in this to really sell my approach (He went home after giving me no clarification about how to do this and what even are they)

- partition aware extraction 
- parallely extracting data (Idts it is even possible)

In the pre-ERP days, most business systems were siloed—HR, finance, sales, you name it—all running on their own. To report on anything meaningful, you had to extract data from each system, often manually. These extracts were pulled at different times, using different rules, and then stitched togethe. The result? Data quality issues. And to make matters worse, people were running these reports directly against transactional databases—systems that were supposed to be optimized for speed and reliability, not analytics. The reporting load bogged them down.

The problem was so painful for the businesses, so around the late 1980s, a few forward-thinking folks—most famously Bill Inmon—proposed a better way: a data warehouse.

To make matter even worse, in the late ’00s every department had its own spreadsheet empire. Finance had one version of “the truth,” Sales had another, and Marketing were inventing their own metrics. People would walk into meetings with totally different numbers for the same KPI.

The spreadsheet party had turned into a data chaos rave. There was no lineage, no source of truth—just lots of tab-switching and passive-aggressive email threads. It wasn’t just annoying—it was a risk. Businesses were making big calls on bad data. So data warehousing became common practice!

1jyve41,Event Sourcing as a creative tool for developers,"Hey, I think there are better use cases for event sourcing.  
  
Event sourcing is an architecture where you capture every change in your system as an immutable event, rather than just storing the latest state. Instead of only knowing what your data looks like now, you keep a full history of how it got there. In a simple crud app that would mean that every deleted, updated, and created entry is stored in your event source, that way when you replay your events you can recreate the state that the application was in at any given time.

Most developers see event sourcing as a kind of technical safety net: - Recovering from failures - Rebuilding corrupted read models - Auditability

Surviving schema changes without too much pain

And fair enough, replaying your event stream often feels like a stressful situation. Something broke, you need to fix it, and you’re crossing your fingers hoping everything rebuilds cleanly.

What if replaying your event history wasn’t just for emergencies? What if it was a normal, everyday part of building your system?

Instead of treating replay as a recovery mechanism, you treat it as a development tool — something you use to evolve your data models, improve your logic, and shape new views of your data over time. More excitingly, it means you can derive entirely new schemas from your event history whenever your needs change.

Your database stops being the single source of truth and instead becomes what it was always meant to be: a fast, convenient cache for your data, not the place where all your logic and assumptions are locked in.

With a full event history, you’re free to experiment with new read models, adapt your data structures without fear, and shape your data exactly to fit new purposes — like enriching fields, backfilling values, or building dedicated models for AI consumption. Replay becomes not about fixing what broke, but about continuously improving what you’ve built.

And this has big implications — especially when it comes to AI and MCP Servers.

Most application databases aren’t built for natural language querying or AI-powered insights. Their schemas are designed for transactions, not for understanding. Data is spread across normalized tables, with relationships and assumptions baked deeply into the structure.

But when you treat your event history as the source of truth, you can replay your events into purpose-built read models, specifically structured for AI consumption.

Need flat, denormalized tables for efficient semantic search? Done. Want to create a user-centric view with pre-joined context for better prompts? Easy. You’re no longer limited by your application’s schema — you shape your data to fit exactly how your AI needs to consume it.

And here’s where it gets really interesting: AI itself can help you explore your data history and discover what’s valuable.

Instead of guessing which fields to include, you can use AI to interrogate your raw events, spot gaps, surface patterns, and guide you in designing smarter read models. It’s a feedback loop: your AI doesn’t just query your data — it helps you shape it.

So instead of forcing your AI to wrestle with your transactional tables, you give it clean, dedicated models optimized for discovery, reasoning, and insight.

And the best part? You can keep iterating. As your AI use cases evolve, you simply adjust your flows and replay your events to reshape your models — no migrations, no backfills, no re-engineering.",14,11,No-Exam2934,2025-04-14 10:15:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jyve41/event_sourcing_as_a_creative_tool_for_developers/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-14 10:15:58,10,Monday,570.0,3470,59.64,28,845,12.2,0,0
1jyxdlb,ETL for Ingesting S3 files and converting to Iceberg,"So, I'm currently working on a project (my first) to create a scalable data platform for a company. The whole thing structured around AWS, initially using DMS to migrate PostgreSQL data to S3 in parquet format (this is our raw datalake). Then using Glue jobs to read this data and create Iceberg tables which would be used in Athena queries and Quicksight. I've got a working Glue script for reading this data and perform upsert operations. Okay so now that I've given a bit of context of what I'm trying to do, let me tell you my problem.  
The client wants me to schedule this job to run every 15min or so for staging and most probably every hour for production. The data in the raw datalake is partitioned by date (for example: s3bucket/table\_name/2025/04/10/file.parquet). Now that I have to run this job every 15 min or so I'm not sure how to keep track of the files that have been processed and which haven't. Currently my script finds the current time and modifies the read command to use just the folder for the current date. But still, this means that I'll be reading all the files in the folder (processed already or not) every time the job runs during the day.   
I've looked around and found that using DynamoDB for keeping track of the files would be my best option but also found something related to Iceberg metadata files that could help me with this. I'm leaning towards the Iceberg option as I wanna make use of all its features but have too little information regarding this to implement. would absolutely appreciate it if someone could help me out with this.

1jytkai,Need Advice on solution - Mapping Inconsistent Country Names to Standardized Values,"Hi Folks,

In my current project, we are ingesting a wide variety of external public datasets. One common issue we’re facing is that the **country names in these datasets are not standardized**. For example, we may encounter entries like **""Burma"" instead of ""Myanmar""**, or **""Islamic Republic of Iran"" instead of ""Iran""**.

My initial approach was to extract all unique country name variations and map them to a list of standard country names using logic such as CASE WHEN conditions or basic string-matching techniques.

However, my manager has suggested we leverage **AI/LLM-based models** to automate the mapping of these country names to a standardized list to handle new query points as well. 

I have a couple of concerns and would appreciate your thoughts:

1. **Is using AI/LLMs a suitable approach for this problem?**
2. **Can LLMs be fully reliable in these mappings, or is there a risk of incorrect matches?**
3. I was considering implementing a **feedback pipeline** that highlights any newly encountered or unmapped country names during data ingestion so we can review and incorporate logic to handle them in the code over time. Would this be a better or complementary solution?
4. Please suggest if there is some better approach.

I’d like to ask for your advice on designing a relational data warehouse fed from our ERP system. We plan to use Power BI as our reporting tool, and all departments in the company will rely on it for analytics.

The challenge is that teams from different departments expect **the data to be fully related and ready** to use when building dashboards, minimizing the need for additional modeling. We’re struggling to determine the best approach to meet these expectations.

What would you recommend?

Should all dimensions and facts be pre-related in the data warehouse, even if it adds complexity?

Creating separate data models in Power BI for different departments/use cases?

Handling all relationships in the data warehouse and exposing them via curated datasets?

Should we empower Power BI users to create their own data models, or enforce strict governance with documented relationships?

1jyv9wq,One of the best Fivetran alternative,"If you're urgently looking for a Fivetran alternative, this might help

Been seeing a lot of people here caught off guard by the new Fivetran pricing. If you're in eCommerce and relying on platforms like Shopify, Amazon, TikTok, or Walmart, the shift to MAR-based billing makes things really hard to predict and for a lot of teams, hard to justify.

If you’re in that boat and actively looking for alternatives, this might be helpful.

**Daton**, built by Saras Analytics, is an ETL tool specifically created for eCommerce. That focus has made a big difference for a lot of teams we’ve worked with recently who needed something that aligns better with how eComm brands operate and grow.

Here are a few reasons teams are choosing it when moving off Fivetran:

**Flat, predictable pricing**  
There’s no MAR billing. You’re not getting charged more just because your campaigns performed well or your syncs ran more often. Pricing is clear and stable, which helps a lot for brands trying to manage budgets while scaling.

**Retail-first coverage**  
Daton supports all the platforms most eComm teams rely on. Amazon, Walmart, Shopify, TikTok, Klaviyo and more are covered with production-grade connectors and logic that understands how retail data actually works.

**Built-in reporting**  
Along with pipelines, Daton includes Pulse, a reporting layer with dashboards and pre-modeled metrics like CAC, LTV, ROAS, and SKU performance. This means you can skip the BI setup phase and get straight to insights.

**Custom connectors without custom pricing**  
If you use a platform that’s not already integrated, the team will build it for you. No surprise fees. They also take care of API updates so your pipelines keep running without extra effort.

**Support that’s actually helpful**  
You’re not stuck waiting in a ticket queue. Teams get hands-on onboarding and responsive support, which is a big deal when you’re trying to migrate pipelines quickly and with minimal friction.

Most eComm brands start with a stack of tools. Shopify for the storefront, a few ad platforms, email, CRM, and so on. Over time, that stack evolves. You might switch CRMs, change ad platforms, or add new tools. But Shopify stays. It grows with you. Daton is designed with the same mindset. You shouldn't have to rethink your data infrastructure every time your business changes. It’s built to scale with your brand.

If you're currently evaluating options or trying to avoid a painful renewal, Daton might be worth looking into. I work with the Saras team and happy to help , here's the link if you want to checkout [https://www.sarasanalytics.com/saras-daton](https://www.sarasanalytics.com/saras-daton)

1jzo8q2,Address & Name matching technique,"Context: 
I have a dataset of company owned products like: Name: Company A, Address: 5th avenue, Product: A. 
Company A inc, Address: New york, Product B. 
Company A inc. , Address, 5th avenue New York, product C. 

I have 400 million entries like these. As you can see, addresses and names are in inconsistent formats. 
I have another dataset that will be me ground truth for companies. It has a clean name for the company along with it’s parsed address. 

The objective is to match the records from the table with inconsistent formats to the ground truth, so that each product is linked to a clean company. 



Questions and help: 
- i was thinking to use google geocoding api to parse the addresses and get geocoding. Then use the geocoding to perform distance search between my my addresses and ground truth BUT i don’t have the geocoding in the ground truth dataset. So, i would like to find another method to match parsed addresses without using geocoding. 

- Ideally, i would like to be able to input my parsed address and the name (maybe along with some other features like industry of activity) and get returned the top matching candidates from the ground truth dataset with a score between 0 and 1. Which approach would you suggest that fits big size datasets? 

- The method should be able to handle cases were one of my addresses could be: company A, address: Washington (meaning an approximate address that is just a city for example, sometimes the country is not even specified). I will receive several parsed addresses from this candidate as Washington is vague. What is the best practice in such cases? As the google api won’t return a single result, what can i do?

- My addresses are from all around the world, do you know if google api can handle the whole world? Would a language model be better at parsing for some regions? 

Help would be very much appreciated, thank you guys.

1jzyxdw,How would you handle the ingestion of thousands of files ?,"Hello,
I’m facing a philosophical question at work and I can’t find an answer that would put my brain at ease. 

Basically we work with Databricks and Pyspark for ingestion and transformation.

We have a new data provider that sends crypted and zipped files to an s3 bucket. There are a couple of thousands of files (2 years of historic).

We wanted to use dataloader from databricks. It’s basically a spark stream that scans folders, finds the files that you never ingested (it keeps track in a table) and reads the new files only and write them.
The problem is that dataloader doesn’t handle encrypted and zipped files (json files inside).

We can’t unzip files permanently. 

My coworker proposed that we use the autoloader to find the files (that it can do) and in that spark stream use the for each batch method to apply a lambda that does:
- get the file name (current row)
-decrypt and unzip
-hash the files (to avoid duplicates in case of failure)
-open the unzipped file using spark
-save in the final table using spark 

I argued that it’s not the right place to do all that and since it’s not the use case of autoloader it’s not a good practice, he argues that spark is distributed and that’s the only thing we care since it allows us to do what we need quickly even though it’s hard to debug (and we need to pass the s3 credentials to each executor using the lambda…)

I proposed a homemade solution which isn’t the most optimal, but it seems better and easier to maintain which is:
- use boto paginator to find files
- decrypt and unzip each file 
- write then json in the team bucket/folder
-create a monitoring table in which we save the file name, hash, status (ok/ko) and exceptions if there are any

He argues that this is not efficient since it’ll only use one single node cluster and not parallelised. 

I never encountered such use case before and I’m kind of stuck, I read a lot of literature but everything seems very generic. 

Edit: we only receive 2 to 3 files daily per data feed (150mo per file on average) but we have 2 years of historical data which amounts to around 1000 files. So we need 1 run for all the historic then a daily run. 
Every feed ingested is a class instantiation (a job on a cluster with a config) so it doesn’t matter if we have 10 feeds. 

Edit2: 1000 files roughly summed to 130go after unzipping. Not sure of average zip/json file though. 

What do you people think of this? Any advices ?

We've built a CRM and are looking to implement a report builder in our app.

We are exploring the best solutions for our needs and it seems like we have two paths we could take:

* Option A: Build the front-end/query builder ourselves and hit read-only replica
* Option B: Build the front-end/query builder ourselves and hit a data warehouse we've built using a key-base replication mechanism on BigQuery/Snowflake, etc..
* Option C: Use third party tools like Explo etc...

About the app:

* Our stack is React, Rails, Postgres.
* Our most used table (contacts) have 20,000,000 rows
* Some of our users have custom fields

We're trying to build something scalable but most importantly not spend months in this project.  
As a result, I'm wondering about the viability of Option A vs. Option B.  
  
One important point is how to manage custom fields that our users created on some objects.

We were thinking about, for contacts for example, we were thinking about simply running with joins across the following tables

* contacts
* contacts\_custom\_fields
* companies (and any other related 1:1 table so we can query fields from related 1:1 objects)
* contacts\_calculated\_fields (materialized view to compute values from 1:many relationship like # of deals the contacts is on)

So the two questions are:

* Would managing all this on the read-only be viable for our volume and a good starting point or will we hit the performance limits soon given our volume?

1jzzf00,My Experience in preparing Azure Data Engineer Associate DP-203.,"So I recently appeared for the DP-203 certification by Microsoft and want to share my learnings and strategy that I followed to crack the exam.

As you all must already be knowing that this exam is labelled as “**Intermediate**” by Microsoft themselves which is perfect in my opinion. This exam does test you in the various concepts that are required for a data engineer to  master in his/her career. 

Having said that, it is not too hard to crack the exam but at the same time also not as easy as appearing for AZ-900. 

DP-203 is aimed at testing the understanding of data related concepts and various tools Microsoft has offered in its suite to make your life easier. Some topics include SQL, Modern Data Warehousing, Python, PySpark, Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure EventHubs, Azure Data Lake Storage and last but not the least Azure Databricks. You can go through the complete set of topics this exam focuses on here - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer/?practice-assessment-type=certification#certification-take-the-exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer/?practice-assessment-type=certification#certification-take-the-exam)



**Courses:**

I had just taken this one course for DP-203 by Alan Rodrigues *(This is not a paid promotion. I just thought that these resources were good to refer to)* and this is a 24 hour long course which has covered all the important and core concepts clearly and precisely. What I loved the most about this course is that it is a complete hands-on course. One more thing is that the instructor very rarely mentions anything as “this has already been covered in the previous sections”. If there is anything that we are using in the current section he makes sure to give a quick background on what has been covered in the earlier sections. Why this is so important is because we tend to forget some things and by just getting a refresher in a couple of sentences we are up to speed. 

For those of you who don’t know, Microsoft offers access to majority resources if not all for FREE credit worth $200 for 30 days. So you simply have to sign up on their portal (insert link) and get access to all of them for 30 days. If you are residing in another country then convert dollars to your local currency. That is how much worth of free credit you will get for 30 days. 

**For example -** 

I live in India. 

1 $ = 87.789 INR 

So I got FREE credits worth 87.789 X 200 = Rs 17,557

Even when I appeared for the exam (Feb 8th, 2025) I hardly got 3-4 questions from the mock tests. But don’t get disheartened. Be sure you are consistent with your learning path and take notes whenever required. As I mentioned earlier, the exam is not very hard.

**Link -** [https://www.udemy.com/course/data-engineering-on-microsoft-azure/learn/lecture/44817315?start=40#overview](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-engineering-on-microsoft-azure/learn/lecture/44817315?start=40#overview)



**Mock Tests Resources:**

So I had referred a couple of resources for taking the mocks which I have mentioned below. *(This is not a paid promotion. I just thought that these resources were good to refer to.)*



1. **Udemy Practice Tests -** [https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-microsoft-azure-dp-203-data-engineering/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING](https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-microsoft-azure-dp-203-data-engineering/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING)
2. **Microsoft Practice Assessments -** [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=49&practice-assessment-type=certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=49&practice-assessment-type=certification)
3. [https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/dp-203/](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/dp-203/)





**DO’s:**



1. Make sure that if and whenever possible you do hands-on for all the sections and videos that have been covered in the Udemy course as I am 100% sure that you will encounter certain errors and would have to explore and solve the errors by yourself. This will build a sense of confidence and achievement after being able to run the pipelines or code all by yourself. (Also don’t forget to delete or pause resources whenever needed so that you get a hang of it and don’t lose out on money. The instructor does tell you when to do so.)
2. Let’s be very practical, nobody remembers all the resolutions or solutions to every single issue or problem faced in the past. We tend to forget things over time and hence it is very important to document everything that you think is useful and would be important in the future. Maintain an excel sheet and create two columns “**Errors” and “Learnings/Resolution**” so that next time you encounter the same issue you already have a solution and don’t waste time. 
3. Watch and practice at least 5-10 videos daily. This way you can complete all the videos in a month and then go back and rewatch lessons you thought were hard. Then you can start giving practice tests. 





**DON'Ts:**



1. By heart all the MCQs or answers to the questions. 
2. Refer to many resources so much so that you will get overwhelmed and not be able to focus on preparation.
3. Even refer to multiple courses from different websites.





**Conclusion:**

All in all, just make sure you do your hands on, practice regularly, give a timeline for yourself, don’t mug up things, don’t by heart things, make sure you use limited but quality resources for learning and practice. I am sure that by following these things you will be able to crack the exam in the first attempt itself.

1jzunnw,"bigquery/sheet/tableau, need for advice","Hello everyone,

I recently joined a project that uses BigQuery for data storage, dbt for transformations, and Tableau for dashboarding. I'd like some advice on improving our current setup.

# Current Architecture

* Data pipelines run transformations using dbt
* Data from BigQuery is synchronized to Google Sheets
* Tableau reports connect to these Google Sheets (not directly to BigQuery)
* Users can modify tracking values directly in Google Sheets

# The Problems

1. **Manual Process**: Currently, the Google Sheets and Tableau connections are created manually during development
2. **Authentication Issues**: In development, Tableau connects using the individual developer's account credentials
3. **Orchestration Concerns**: We have Google Cloud Composer for orchestration, but the Google Sheets synchronization happens separately

# Questions

1. What's the best way to automate the creation and configuration of Google Sheets in this workflow? Is there a Terraform approach or another IaC solution?
2. How should we properly manage connection strings in tableau between environments, especially when moving from development (using personal accounts) to production?

1jztbwd,API Help,"Hello, I am working on a personal ETL project with a beginning goal of trying to ingest data from Google Books API and batch insert into pg.  


Currently I have a script that cleans the API result into a list which is then inserted into pg. But, I have many repeat values each time I run this query, resulting in no data being inserted into pg.

I also notice that I get very random books that are not at all on topic for what I specific with my query parameters. e.g. title='data' and author=' '. 

  
I am wondering if anybody knows how to get only relevant data with API calls, as well as non duplicate value with each run of the script (eg persistent pagination).

  
Example of a \~320 book query.

In the first result I get somewhat data-related books. However, in the second result i get results such as: ""Homoeopathic Journal of Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Paedology"".

I understand that this is a broad query, but when I specify I end up getting very few book results(\~40-80), which is surprising because I figured a Google API would have more data.

1jznrvv,Database design problem for many to many data relationship...need suggestions,"I have to come up with a database design working on postgres. I have to migrate at the end almost trillions volumes of data into a postgres DB wherein CRUD operations can be run most efficiently. The data present is in the form of a many to many relationship. How the data looks is:  
  
In my old data base i have a value T1 which is connected to on average 700 values (like x1,x2,x3...x700). Here in the old DB we are saving 700 records of this connection. Similarly other values like T2,T3,T100 all have multiple connections each having a separate row

Use case:  
We need to make updates,deletions and inserts to both values of T and values of X  
for example,  
I am given That value T1 instead of 700 connections of X has now 800 connections...so i must update or insert all the new connections corresponding to T1  
And like wise if I am given , we need to update all T values X1 (say X1 has 200 connection of T) i need to insert/update or delete T values associated with X1.

  
for now, I was thinking of aggregating my data in the form of a jsonb column  
where  
Column T             Column X (jsonb)  
T1                           {""value"":\[X1,X2,X3.....X700\]}

But i will have to create another similar table where i keep column T as jsonb. Since any updates in one table needs to be synced to the other any errors may cause it to be out of sync.

Also the time taken to read and update a jsonb row will be high

Any other suggestions on how i should think about creating schema for my problem?",1,2,CollectionPerfect248,2025-04-15 09:41:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jznrvv/database_design_problem_for_many_to_many_data/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-15 09:41:51,9,Tuesday,274.0,1509,63.22,11,383,11.6,0,0
1jzvfys,"Event sourcing isn’t about storing history. it’s about replaying it.
Discussion","Replay isn’t just about fixing broken systems. It’s about rethinking how we build them in the first place. If your data architecture is driven by immutable events instead of current state, then replay stops being a recovery mechanism and starts becoming a way to continuously reshape, refine, and evolve your system with zero fear of breaking things.

Let’s talk about replay :)

**Event sourcing is misunderstood**  
For most developers, event sourcing shows up as a safety mechanism. It’s there to recover from a failure, rebuild a read model, trace an audit trail, or get through a schema change without too much pain. Replay is something you reach for in the rare cases when things go sideways.

That’s how it’s typically treated. A fallback. Something reactive.

But that lens is narrow. It frames replay as an emergency tool instead of something more fundamental. When events are treated as the source of truth, replay can become a normal, repeatable part of development. Not just a way to recover, but a way to refine.

**What if replay wasn’t just for emergencies?**  
What if it was a routine, even joyful, part of building your system?

Instead of treating replay as a recovery mechanism, you treat it as a development tool. Something you use to evolve your data models, improve your business logic, and shape entirely new views of your data over time. And more excitingly, it means you can derive entirely new schemas from your event history whenever your needs change.

**Why replay is so hard in most setups**  
Here’s the catch. In most event-sourced systems, **events are emitted after your app logic runs**. Your API gets the request, updates the database, and only then emits a change event. That event is a side effect, not the source of truth.

So when you want to replay, it gets tricky. You need replay-safe logic. You need to carefully version events. You need infrastructure to reprocess historical data. And you have to make absolutely sure you’re not double-applying anything.

That’s why replay often feels fragile. It’s not that the idea is bad. It’s just hard to pull off.

**But what if you flip the model?**  
What if events come first, not last?

That’s the approach we took.

A user action, like creating a user, updating an address, or assigning a tag, sends an event. That event is immediately appended to an immutable event store, **and only then** is it passed along to the application API to validate and store in the database.

Suddenly your database isn’t your source of truth. It’s just a read model. A fast, disposable output of your event stream.

So when you want to evolve your logic or reshape your data structure, all you have to do is update your flow, delete the old database, and press replay.

That’s it.

No migrations.  
No fragile ETL jobs.  
No one-off backfills.  
Just replay your history into the new shape.

**Your data becomes fluid**  
Say you’re running an e-commerce platform, and six months in, you realize you never tracked the discount code a customer used at checkout. It wasn’t part of the original schema. Normally, this would mean a migration, a painful manual backfill (if the data even still exists), or writing a fragile script to stitch it in later, assuming you’re lucky enough to recover it.

But with a full event history, you don’t need to hack anything.

You just update your flow logic to extract the discount code from the original checkout events. Then replay them.

Within minutes, your entire dataset is updated. The new field is populated everywhere it should have been, as if it had been there from day one.

**Your database becomes what it was always meant to be**  
A cache.  
Not a source of truth.  
Something you can throw away and rebuild without fear.  
You stop treating your schema like a delicate glass sculpture and start treating it like software.

**Replay unlocks AI-native data (with MCP Servers)**  
Most application databases are optimized for transactions, not understanding. They’re normalized, rigid, and shaped around application logic, not meaning. That’s fine for serving an app. But for AI? Nope.

Language models thrive on context. They need denormalized, readable structures. They need relationships spelled out. They need the why, not just the what.

When you have an event history, not just state but actions and intent. You can replay those events into entirely new shapes. You can build read models that are tailored specifically for AI: flattened tables for semantic search, user-centric structures for chat interfaces, agent-friendly layouts for reasoning.

And it’s not just one-and-done. You can reshape your models over and over as your use cases evolve. No migrations. No backfills. Just a new flow and a replay.

What is even more interesting is that with the help of MCP Servers AI can help you do this. By interrogating the event history with natural language prompts, it can suggest new model structures, flag gaps, and uncover meaning you didn’t plan for. It’s a feedback loop: replay helps AI make sense of your data, and AI helps you decide how to replay.

And none of this works without events that store intent. Current state is just a snapshot. Events tell the story.

**So, why doesn’t everyone build this way?**  
Because it’s hard. You need immutable storage. Replay-safe logic. Tools to build and maintain read models. Schema evolution support. Observability. Infrastructure to safely reprocess everything.

The architecture has been around for a while — Martin Fowler helped popularize event sourcing nearly two decades ago. But most teams ran into the same issue: implementing it well was too complex for everyday use.

That’s the reason behind the Flowcore Platform To make this kind of architecture not just possible, but effortless. Flowcore handles the messy parts. The ingestion, the immutability, the reprocessing, the flow management, the replay. So you can just build. You send an event, define what you want done with it, and replay it whenever you need to improve.",0,3,OAEareMyInitials,2025-04-15 15:55:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jzvfys/event_sourcing_isnt_about_storing_history_its/,0,False,2025-04-15 16:09:47,False,False,2025-04-15 15:55:44,15,Tuesday,995.0,6011,76.52,85,1433,9.2,0,0

1k0t6ua,Switching batch jobs to streaming,"Hi folks. My company is trying to switch some batch jobs to streaming. The current method is that the data are streaming data through Kafka, then there's a Spark streaming job that consumes the data and appends them to a raw table (with schema defined, so not 100% raw). Then we have some scheduled batch jobs (also Spark) that read data from the raw table, transform the data, load them into destination tables, and show them in the dashboards. We use Databricks for storage (Unity catalog) and compute (Spark), but use something else for dashboards.

Now we are trying to switch these scheduled batch jobs into streaming, since the incoming data are already streaming anyway, why not make use of it and turn our dashboards into realtime. It makes sense from business perspective too.

However, we've been facing some difficulty in rewriting the transformation jobs from batch to streaming. Turns out, Spark streaming doesn't support some imporant operations in batch. Here are a few that I've found so far:

1. Spark streaming doesn't support window function (e.g. : ROW\_NUMBER() OVER (...)). Our batch transformations have a lot of these.
2. Joining streaming dataframes is more complicated, as you have to deal with windows and watermarks (I guess this is important for dealing with unbounded data). So it breaks many joining logic in the batch jobs.
3. Aggregations are also more complicated. For example you can't do this: raw\_df -> get aggregated df from raw\_df -> join aggregated\_df with raw\_df

So far I have been working around these limitations by using Foreachbatch and using intermediary tables (Databricks delta table). However, I'm starting to question this approach, as the pipelines get more complicated. Another method would be refactoring the entire transformation queries to conform both the business logic and streaming limitations, which is probably not feasible in our scenario.

Have any of you encountered such scenario and how did you deal with it? Or maybe do you have some suggestions or ideas?

1k0rxxi,Criticism at work because my lack of understanding business requirements is coinciding with quick turnaround times,"Hi,

I'm looking for sincere advice.

I'm basically a data/analytics engineer. My tasks generally are like this

1. put configurations so that the source dataset can ingest and preprocess into aws s3 in correct file format. I've noticed sometimes filepath names randomly change without warning which would cause configs to change so I would have to be cognizant of that. 

2. the s3 output is then put into a mapping tool (which in my experience is super slow and frequently annoying to use) we have to map source -> our schema

3. once you update things in the mapping tool, it SHOULD export automatically to S3 and show in production environment after refresh, which is usually. However, keyword should. There are times where my data didn't show up and it turned out I have to 'manually export' a file to S3 without being made aware beforehand which files require manual export and which ones occur automatically through our pipeline

4. I then usually have to develop a SQL view that combines data from various sources for different purposes

The issues I'm facing lately....

A colleague left end of last year and I've noticed that my workload has dramatically changed. I've been given tasks that I can only assume were once hers from another colleague. The thing is the tasks I'm given:

1. Have zero documentation. I have no clue what the task is meant to accomplish

2. I have very vague understanding of the source data 

3. Just go off of an either previously completed script, which sometimes suffers from major issues (too many subqueries, thousands of lines of code). Try to realistically manage how/if to refactor vs. using same code and 'coming back to it later' if I have time constraints. After using similar code, randomly realize the requirements of old script changed b/c my data doesn't populate in which I have to ask my boss what the issue 

4. Me and my boss have to navigate various excel sheets and communication to play 'guess work' as to what the requirements are so we can get something out 

5. Review them with the colleague who assigned it to me who points out things are wrong OR randomly changes the requirements that causes me to make more changes and then expresses frustration 'this is unacceptable', 'this is getting delayed', 'I am getting frustrated' continuously that is making me uncomfortable in asking questions.

I do not directly interact with the stakeholders. The colleague I just mentioned is the person who does and translates requirements back. I really, honestly have no clue what is going through the stakeholders mind or how they intend to use the product. All I frequently hear is that 'they are not happy', 'I am frustrated', 'this is too slow'. I am expected to get things out within few hours to 1-2 business days. This doesn't give me enough time to ensure if I made many mistakes in the process. I will take accountability that I have made some mistakes in this process by fixing things then not checking and ensuring things are as expected that caused further delays. Overall, I am under constant pressure to churn things out ASAP and I'm struggling to keep up and feel like many mistakes are a result of the pressure to do things fast.

I have told my boss and colleague in detail (even wrote it up) that it would be helpful for me to: 1. just have 1-2 sentences as to what this project is trying to accomplish 2. better documentation.  People have agreed with me but they have not really done much b/c everybody is too busy to document since once one project is done, I'm pulled into the next. I personally am observing a technical debt problem here, but I am new to my job and new to data engineering (was previously in a different analytics role) so I am trying to figure out if this is a me issue and where I can take accountability or this speaks to broader issues with my team and I should consider another job. I am honestly thinking about starting the job search again in a few months, but I am quite discouraged with my current experience and starting to notice signs of burnout.",5,1,thro0away12,2025-04-16 18:40:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k0rxxi/criticism_at_work_because_my_lack_of/,1,False,False,False,False,2025-04-16 18:40:02,18,Wednesday,713.0,4049,59.33,35,1037,11.8,0,0
1k0n177,migrating from No-Code middleware platform to another more fundamental tech stack,"Hey everyone, 

we are a company that relies heavy on a so called no-code middleware that combines many different aspects of typical data engineering stuff into one big platform. However we have found ourselves (finally) in the situation that we need to migrate to a lets say more fundamental tech stack that relies more on knowledge about programming, databases and sql. I wanted to ask if someone has been in the same situation and what their experiences have been. Our only option right now is to migrate for business reasons and it will happen, the only question is what we are going to use and how we will use it. 

**Background:**  
We use this platform as our main ""engine"" or tool to map various business proccess. The platform includes creation and management of various kinds of ""connectors"" including Http, as2, mail, x400 and whatnot. You can then create profiles that can get fetch and transform data based on what comes in by one of the connectors and load the data directly into your database, create files or do whatever the business logic requires. The platform provides a comprehensive amount of logging and administration. In my honest opinion, that is quite a lot that this tool can offer. Does anyone know any kind of other tool that can do the same? I heard about Apache Airflow or Apache Nifi but only on the surface. 

The same platform we are using right now has another software solution for building database entities on top of its own database structure to create ""input masks"" for users to create, change or read data and also apply business logic. We use this tool to provide whole platforms and even ""build"" basic websites. 

What would be the best tech stack to migrate to if your goal was to cover all of the above? I mean there probably is not an all in one solution but that is not what we are looking for right now. If you said to me that for example apache nifi in combination with python would be enough to cover everything our middleware provided would be more than enough for me.  
  
What is essential for us is also a good logging capability. We need to make sure that whatever data flows are happening or have happended is comprehensible in case of errors or questions. 

For input masks and simple web platforms we are currently using C# Blazor and have multiple projects that are working very well, which we could also migrate to.

1k0yejp,Obtaining accurate and valuable datasets for Uni project related to social media analytics.,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working on my final project titled **“The Evolution of Social Media Engagement: Trends Before, During, and After the COVID-19 Pandemic.”**

I’m specifically looking for **free datasets** that align with this topic, but I’ve been having trouble finding ones that are accessible without high costs — especially as a full-time college student. Ideally, I need to be able to **download the data as CSV files** so I can import them into **Tableau** for visualizations and analysis.

Here are a few research questions I’m focusing on:

1. How did engagement levels on major social media platforms change between the early and later stages of the pandemic?
2. What patterns in user engagement (e.g., time of day or week) can be observed during peak COVID-19 months?
3. Did social media engagement decline as vaccines became widely available and lockdowns began to ease?

I’ve already found a couple of datasets on **Kaggle** (linked below), and I may use some information from **gs.statcounter**, though that data seems a bit too broad for my needs.

If anyone knows of any other relevant **free data sources**, or has suggestions on where I could look, I’d really appreciate it!

I’m working on a FinOps initiative to improve cloud cost visibility and attribution across departments and projects in our data platform.

My goal is to be able to print out: total project cost = azure stuff + sql serverless.

Is creating a separate SQL Warehouse per department/project the only way to track department/project usage or is there any other way?

with colleagues we are debating what would be the best solution to create list of users-id giving simple criterions.

let's take an example of line we have

    01,group1,0.2
    02,group1,0.4
    03,group2,0.5
    04,group1,0.6
    

let say we only want the subset of user id that are part of the group1 and that have NUM > 0.3 ; it will give us 02 and 04.

We have currently theses list in S3 parquet (partionned by GROUP, NUM or other dimensionq). We want results in plain CSV files in S3. We have really a lot of it (multi billions of rows). Other constraints are we want to create theses sublist every hours (giving the fact that source are constantly changing) so relatively fast, also we have multiple ""select"" criterions and finally want to keep cost under control.

Currently we fill a big AWS Redshift cluster where we load our inputs from the datalake and make big select to output lists. It worked but clearly show its limits. Adding more dimension will definitely kill it. 

I was thinking this not a good fit as Redshift is a column oriented analytic DB. Personally I would advocate for using spark (with EMR) to directly <filter and produce S3 files. Some are arguing that we could use another Database. Ok but which? (I don't really get the why)

1k0ukfy,Your Teams Development Approach,"Currently I am wondering how other teams do their development and especially testing their pipelines.

I am the sole data engineer at a medical research institute. We do everything on premise, mostly in windows world. Due to me being self taught and having no other engineers to learn from I keep implementing things the same way:

Step 1: Get some source data and do some exploration

Step 2: Design a pipeline and a model that is the foundation for the README file

Step 3: Write the main ETL script and apply some defensive programming principles

Step 4: Run the script on my sample data which would have two outcomes:

1. Everything went well? Okay, add more data and try again!

2. Something breaks? See if it is a data quality or logic error, add some nice error handling and run again!

At some point the script will run on all the currently known source data and can be released. Over the course of the process I will add logging, some DQ checks on the DB and add alerting for breaking errors. I try to keep my README up to date with my thought process and how the pipeline works and push it to our self hosted Gitea.

I tried tinkering around with pytest and added some unit tests for complicated deserialization or source data that requires external knowledge. But when I tried setting up integration testing and end to end testing it always felt like so much work. Trying to keep my test environments up to date while also delivering new solutions seems to always end up with me cutting corners on testing. 

At this point I suspect that there might be some way to make this whole testing setup more reproducable and less manual. I really want to be able to onboard new people, if we ever hire, and not let them face an untestable mess of legacy code.

1k0kjbu,GCP Professional Data Engineer,"Hey guys,

I would like to hear your thoughts or suggestions on something I’m struggling with. I’m currently preparing for the Google Cloud Data Engineer certification, and I’ve been going through the official study materials on Google Cloud SkillBoost. Unfortunately, I’ve found the experience really disappointing.

The ""Data Engineer Learning Path"" feels overly basic and repetitive, especially if you already have some experience in the field. Up to Unit 6, they at least provide PDFs, which I could skim through. But starting from Unit 7, the content switches almost entirely to videos — and they’re long, slow-paced, and not very engaging. Worse still, they don’t go deep enough into the topics to give me confidence for the exam.

When I compare this to other prep resources — like books that include sample exams — the SkillBoost material falls short in covering the level of detail and complexity needed.  


How did you prepare effectively? Did you use other resources you’d recommend?

1k0jkfv,Data Mapping,"We have created an AI model and algorithms that enable us to map an organisations data landscape. This is because we found all data catalogs fell short of context to be able to enable purpose-based governance.

Effectively, it enables us to map and validate all data purposes, processing activities, business processes, data uses, data users, systems and service providers automatically without stakeholder workshops - but we are struggling with the last hurdle. 

We are attempting to use the data context to infer (with help from scans of core environments) data fields, document types, business logic, calculations and metrics. We want to create an anchor ""data asset"". 

The difficulty we are having is how do we define the data assets. We need that anchor definition to enable cross-functional utility, so it can't be linked to just one concept (ie purpose, use, process, rights). This is because the idea is that:
- lawyers can use it for data rights and privacy
- technology can use it for AI, data engineering and cyber security 
- commercial can use it for data value, opportunities, decision making and strategy 
- operations can use it for efficiency and automation


We are thinking we need a ""master definition"" that clusters related fields / key words / documents and metrics to uses, processes etc. and then links that to context, but how do we create the names of the clusters! 

Everything we try falls flat, semantic, contextual, etc. All the data catalogs we have tested don't seem to help us actually define the data assets - it assumes you have done this! 

Can anyone tell me how they have done this at thier organisation? Or how you approached defining the data assets you have?

The core message was that robust observability requires multiple layers.

**2. Metrics** (to quantify performance, cost, and errors),  
**3 .Quality/Eval** evaluation (critically assessing response validity and relevance),

1k1c0cc,Star schema implementation in Glue + Redshift.,"I'm setting up a Glue (Spark) to Redshift pipeline with incremental SQL loads, and while fact tables are straightforward (just append new records), dimension tables are more complex to be honest - I have a few questions regarding the practical implementation of a star schema data warehouse model ?   
  
First, avoiding duplicates, transactional facts won't have this issue because they will be unique, but for dimensions it is not the case,  do you pre-filter in Spark (reads existing Redshift dim tables and ensure new chunks of dim tables are new records) or just dump everything to Redshift and let it deduplicate (let Redshift handle upinserts)?   
  
Second, surrogate keys, they have to be globally unique across all the table because they will serve as primary keys, do you generate them in Spark (risk collisions across job runs) or use Redshift IDENTITY for example?   
  
Third, SCD Type 2: implement change detection in Spark (comparing new vs old records) or handle it in Redshift (with MERGE/triggers)? Would love to hear real-world experiences on what actually scales, especially for large dimensions (10M+ rows) - how do you balance the Spark vs Redshift work while keeping everything consistent?

Last but not least I want to know how to ensure fact tables are properly pointing to dimension tables, do we fill the foreign key column in spark before loading to redshift?

1k1pl3y,"A databricks project, a tight deadline, and a PIP.","Hey r/dataengineering, I need your help to find a solution to my dumpster fire and potentially save a soul (or two)).

I'm working together with an older dev who has been put on a project and it's a mess left behind by contractors. I noticed he's on some kind of PIP thing, and the project has a set deadline which is not realistic. It could be both of us are set up to fail. The code is the worst I have seen in my ten years in the field. No tests, no docs, a mix of prod and test, infra mixed with application code, a misunderstanding of how classes and scope work, etc.

The project itself is a ""library"" that syncing databricks with data from an external source. We query the external source and insert data into databricks, and every once in a while query the source again for changes (for sake of discussion, lets assume these are page reads per user) which need to be done incrementally. We also frequently submit new jobs to the external source with the same project. what we ingest from the source is not a lot of data, usually under 1 million rows and rarely over 100k a day. 

Roughly 75% of the code is doing computation in python for databricks, where they first pull out the dataframe and then filter it down with python and spark. The remaining 25% is code to wrap the API on the external source. All code lives in databricks and is mostly vanilla python. It is called from a notebook. (...)

My only idea is that the ""library"" should be split instead of having to do everything. The ingestion part of the source can be handled by dbt and we can make that work first. The part that holds the logic to manipulate the dataframes and submit new jobs to the external api is buggy and I feel it needs to be gradually rewritten, but we need to double the features to this part of the code base if we are to make the deadline. 

I'm already pushing back on the deadline and I'm pulling in another DE to work on this, but I am wondering what my technical approach should be.",5,5,MyBossIsOnReddit,2025-04-17 22:28:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k1pl3y/a_databricks_project_a_tight_deadline_and_a_pip/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-17 22:28:41,22,Thursday,374.0,1981,75.84,18,481,10.0,0,0
1k1p04c,Practical Implementation of Data Warehouses with Spark (and Redshift),"Serious question to those who have done some data warehousing where Spark/Glue is the transformation engine, bonus if the data warehouse is Redshift.

This is my first time putting a data warehouse in place, and , I am doing so with AWS Glue and Redshift. The data load is incremental.

While in theory dimensional modeling ( star schemas to be exact ) is not hard, I am finding a hard time implementing the actual model.

I want to know how are these dimensional modeling concepts are actually implemented, the following is  my thoughts about how I understand some theoretical concepts and the way I find gaps between them and the actual practice.

**Avoiding duplicates in both fact and dimension tables** –does this happen in the Spark job or Redshift itself? 

I feel like for transactional fact tables it is not a problem, but for dimensions, it is not straight forward: you need to insure uniqueness of entries for all the table not just the chunk you loaded during this run and this raises the above question, whether it is done in Spark, and in this case we will need to somehow load the dimension table  in dataframes so that we can filter new data loads, or in redshidt, and in this case we just load everything new to Redshift and delegate upserts and duplication checks to Redshift.

  
And speaking of uniqueness of entries in dimension tables ( I know it is getting long, bear with me, we are almost there xD) , we have to also allow exceptions, because when dealing with **SCD type 2,** we must allow duplicate entries and update the old ones to be depricated, so again how is this exception implemented practically? 

**Surrogate keys** – Generate in Spark (eg. UUIDs/hashes?) or rely on Redshift `IDENTITY` for example?

Surrogate keys are going to serve as primary keys for both our fact and dimension tables, so they have to be unique, again do we generate them in Spark then load to, Redshift or do we just make Redshift handle these for us and not worry about uniqueness? 

**Fact-dim integrity** – Resolve FKs in Spark or after loading to Redshift?

Another concern arises when talking about surrogate keys, each fact table has to point to its dimensions with FKs, which in reality will be the surrogate keys of the dimensions, so these columns need to be filled with the right values, I am wondering whether this is done in Spark, and in this case we will have to again load the dimensions from Redshift in Spark dataframes and extract the right values of FKs, or can this be done in Reshift????

I currently work as a BA/project lead in the ESG space, and I’ve spotted a business gap in the geospatial data industry that I’d love to explore as a potential DAAS (Data-as-a-Service) venture.

I have solid product ownership and requirements gathering skills, understand the data sources well, and have a good grasp of database structuring. 

However, I don't have coding skills—so I’m wondering how best to approach this.
Where would you start if you were in my shoes?

1k1wtbm,Data Pipeline Question,"I'm fairly new to the idea of ETL even though I've read about and followed it for years; however, the implementation is what I have a question about.

Our needs have migrated towards the idea of Spark so I'm thinking of building our pipeline in Scala.  I've used it on and off in the past so it's not a foreign language for me.

However, the question I have is should I build our workflow and hard code it from A-Z (data ingestion, create or replace, populate tables) outside of snowflake, or is it better practice to have it fragmented and saved as snowflake worksheets?  My aim with this change would be strongly typed services that can't be ""accidentally"" fired off.

I'm thinking the pipeline would be more of a spot instance that is fired off with certain configs with the A-Z only allowed for certain logins.  There aren't many people on the team but there are people working with tables that have drop permissions (not from me) and I just want to be prepared for disasters and recovery.

It's like a mini-dream whereas I'm in full control of the data and ingestion pipelines but everything is sql currently.  Therefore, we are building from scratch right now and the Scala system would mainly be a disaster recovery so made to repopulate tables, or to ingest a new set of raw data to be transformed and loaded (updates).

This is a non-profit so I don't want to load them up with huge bills (databricks) so I do want to do most of the stuff myself with the help of apache.  I understand there are numerous options but essentially it's going to be like this

Scala server -> Apache Spark -> ML Categorization From Spark -> Snowflake

Since we are ingesting data I figured we should mix in the machine learning while transforming and processing to save on time and headaches.

WHY I DIDN'T CHOOSE SNOWPARK:  
After looking over snowpark I see it as a great gateway for people either needing pure speed, or those who are newer to software engineering and needing a box to be in.  I'm well-versed in pandas, numpy, etc. so I wanted to be able to break the mold at any point.  I know this may not be preferable for snowflake people but I have about a decade of experience writing complex software systems, and I didn't want vendor lock-in so I hope that can be respected to some extent.  If I am blatantly wrong then please let me know how snowpark is better.  

  
Note: I do see snowpark offers Scala (or something like that); however, the point isn't solely to use Scala, I come from Golang and want a sturdy pipeline that won't run into breaking changes and make it a JVM shop.

Any other advice from engineers here on other things I should recommend would be greatly appreciated as well.  Scraping is a huge concern, which is why I chose Golang off the bat, but scraping new data can't objectively be the main priority, I feel like there are other things that I might be unaware of.  Maybe a checklist of things that I can make sure we have just so we don't run into major issues then I catch the blame shift.

Therefore, please be gentle I am not the most well-versed in data engineering but I do see it as a fascinating discipline that I'd like to find a niche in if possible.",2,1,Sufficient_Ant_3008,2025-04-18 04:51:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k1wtbm/data_pipeline_question/,1,False,False,False,False,2025-04-18 04:51:51,4,Friday,579.0,3185,60.58,21,781,10.9,0,1
1k1uh7y,Attempting to Solve the Cross-Platform AI Billing Challenge as a Solo Engineer/Founder - Need Feedback,"Hey Everyone

I'm a self-taught solo engineer/developer (with university + multi-year professional software engineer experience) developing a solution for a growing problem I've noticed many organizations are facing: managing and optimizing spending across multiple AI and LLM platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Midjourney, etc.).

# The Problem I'm Research / Attempting to Address:

From my own research and conversations with various teams, I'm seeing consistent challenges:

* No centralized way to track spending across multiple AI providers
* Difficulty attributing costs to specific departments, projects, or use cases
* Inconsistent billing cycles creating budgeting headaches
* Unexpected cost spikes with limited visibility into their causes
* Minimal tools for forecasting AI spending as usage scales

# My Proposed Solution

Building a platform-agnostic billing management solution that would:

* Provide a unified dashboard for all AI platform spending
* Enable project/team attribution for better cost allocation
* Offer usage analytics to identify optimization opportunities
* Include customizable alerts for budget management
* Generate forecasts based on historical usage patterns

# I Need Your Input:

Before I go too deep into development, I want to make sure I'm building something that genuinely solves problems:

1. What features would be most valuable for your organization?
2. What platforms beyond the major LLM providers should we support?
3. How would you ideally integrate this with your existing systems?
4. What reporting capabilities are most important to you?
5. How do you currently handle this challenge (manual spreadsheets, custom tools, etc.)?

Seriously would love your insights and/or recommendations of other projects I could build because I'm pretty good at launching MVPs extremely quickly (few hours to 1 week MAX).",2,1,Frozen-Insightful-22,2025-04-18 02:37:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k1uh7y/attempting_to_solve_the_crossplatform_ai_billing/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-18 02:37:18,2,Friday,273.0,1862,13.31,8,481,19.0,0,0

1k1l7vo,"MS ACCESS, no clickbait, kinda long","Hello to all,

Thank you for reading the following and talking the time to answer.

I'm a consultant and I work as...non idea what I am, maybe you'll tell me what I am.

In my current project (1+ years) I normally do stored procedures in tsql, I create reports towards Excel, sometimes powerbi, and...AND...AAAANNDDD * drums * Ms access (yeah, same as title says).

So many things happens inside ms access, mainly views from tsql and some...how can I call them? Like certain ""structures"" inside, made by a dude that was 7 years (yes, seven, S-E-V-E-N) on the project. These structures have a nice design with filters, with inputs, outputs. During this 1+ year I somehow made some modifications which worked (I was the first one surprised, most of the times I had no idea what I was doing, but it was working and nobody complained so, *shoulder pat* to me).

The thing is that I enjoy all the (buzz word incoming) * ✨️✨️✨️automation✨️✨️✨️"" like the jobs, the procedures that do stuff etc. I enjoy tsql, is very nice. It can do a lot of shit (still trying to figure out how to send automatic mails, some procedures done by the previous dude already send emails with csv inside, for now it's black magic for me). The jobs and their schedule is pure magic. It's nice. 

Here comes the actual dilemma:

I want to do stuff. I'm taking some courses on SSIS (for now it seems it does the same as a stored procedures with extra steps+no code, but I trust the process).

How can I replace the entire ms access tool? How can I create a menu with stuff, like ""Sales, Materials, Aquisitions"" etc, where I have to put filters (as end user) to find shit. 

For every data eng. positions i see instruments required such as sql, no sql, postgresql, mongodb, airflow, snowflake, apake, hadoop, databricks, python, pyspark, Tableau, powerbi, click, aws, azure, gcp, my mother's virginity. I've taken courses (coursera / udemy) on almost all and they don't do magic. It seems they do pretty much what tsql can do (except ✨️✨️✨️ cloud ✨️✨️✨️).

In python I did some things, mainly stuff about very old excel format files, since they come from a sap Oracle cloud, they come sometimes with rows/columns positioned where they shouldn't have been, so, I stead of the 99999+ rows of VBA script my predecessor did, I use 10 rows of python to do the same.

So, coming back to my question, is there something to replace Ms access? Keeping the simplicity and also the utility it has, but also ✨️✨️✨️future proof✨️✨️✨️, like, in 5 years when fresh people will come in my place (hopefully faster than 5y) they will have some contemporary technology to work with instead of stone age tools.

1k3m7d4,Advice wanted: planning a Streamlit + DuckDB geospatial app on Azure (Web App Service + Function),"Hey all,

I’m in the design phase for a lightweight, map‑centric web app and would love a sanity check before I start provisioning Azure resources.

Proposed architecture:
- Front‑end: Streamlit container in an Azure Web App Service. It plots store/parking locations on a Leaflet/folium map.
- Back‑end: FastAPI wrapped in an Azure Function (Linux custom container). DuckDB runs inside the function.
- Data: A ~200 MB GeoParquet file in Azure Blob Storage (hot tier).
- Networking: Web App ↔ Function over VNet integration and Private Endpoints; nothing goes out to the public internet.
- Data flow: User input → Web App calls /locations → Function queries DuckDB → returns payloads.

Open questions

	1.	Function vs. always‑on container: Is a serverless Azure Function the right choice, or would something like Azure Container Apps (kept warm) be simpler for DuckDB workloads? Cold‑start worries me a bit.

	2.	Payload format: For ≤ 200 k rows, is it worth the complexity of sending Arrow/Polars over HTTP, or should I stick with plain JSON for map markers? Any real‑world gains?

	3.	Pre‑processing beyond “query from Blob”: I might need server‑side clustering, hexbin aggregation, or even vector‑tile generation to keep the payload tiny. Where would you put that logic—inside the Function, a separate batch job, or something else?

	4.	Gotchas: Security, cost surprises, deployment quirks? Anything you wish you’d known before launching a similar setup?

1k3pnjf,How do you balance short and long term as an IC,"Hi all ! I'm an analytics engineer not DE but felt it would be relevant to ask this here.

When you're taking on a new project, how do you think about balancing turning something around asap vs really digging in and understanding and possibly delivering something better? 

For example, I have a report I'm updating and adding to. On one extreme, I could probably ship the thing in like a week without much of an understanding outside of what's absolutely necessary to understand to add what needs to be added.

1k3gadk,Slowness of Small Data,"Got a meeting coming up with high profile data analysts at my org that primarily use SAS which doesn’t like large CSV or parquet (with their current version) drawing from MSSQL/otherMScrap. I can give them all their data, daily, (5gb parquet or whatever that is —more— as csv) right to their doorstep in secured Shaerpoint/OnDrive folders they can sync in their OS.

Their primary complaint is slowness of SAS drawing data.  They also seem misguided with their own MSSQL DBs. Instead of using schemas, they just spin up a new DB. All tables have owner DBO. Is this normal? They don’t use Git. My heart wants to show them so many things:

DataWrangler in VS Code
DuckDB in DBeaver (or Harelquin, Vim-dadbod, the new local Motherduck UI)
Streamlit
pygwalker

Our org is pressing hard for them to adapt to using PBI/Fabric, and I feel they should go a different direction given their needs (speed), ability to upskill (they use SAS, Excel, SSMS, Cognos… they do not use VS Code/any-IDE, Git, Python), and constraints (high workload, limited and fixed staff & $. Public Sector, HighEd.

My boss recommended I show them VS Code Data Wrangler. Which is fine with me…but they are on managed machines, have never installed/used VS Code, but let me know they “think its in their software center”, god knows what that means.

I’m a little worried if I screw this meeting up,  I’ll kill any hope these folks would adapt/evolve, get with the times. There’s queries that take 45 min on their current setup that are sub-second on parquet/DuckDB. And as retarded as Fabric is, it’s also complicated. IMO, more complicated than the awesome FOSS stuff heavily trained by LLMs. I really think DBT would be a game changer too, but nobody at my org uses anything like it. And notebook/one-off development vs. DRY is causing real obstacles.

Let’s say a user post something on the platform, it doesn’t just crash or say “sent” and then it’s maybe not. Are there process to ensure that if something goes wrong the app handles it or this because this doesn’t happen very often nobody care ? Like the use will repost it’s thing if it didn’t work

* Source system = \[insert your DB or system here, e.g., PostgreSQL used by Odoo\]

1k408vu,Seeking Advice - Is DE at Meta worth pursuing?,"Hello fellow DEs!

I’m hoping to get some career advice from the experienced folks in this sub.

I have 4.5 YOE and a related master’s degree. Most of my experience has been in DE consulting, but earlier this year I grew tired of the consulting grind and began looking for something new. I applied to a bunch of roles, including a few at Meta, but never made it past initial screenings.

Fast forward to now — I landed a senior DE position at a well-known crypto exchange about 4 months ago. I’m enjoying it so far: I’ve been given a lot of autonomy, there’s room for impactful infrastructure work, and I’m helping shape how data is handled org-wide. We use a fairly modern stack: Snowflake, Databricks, Airflow, AWS, etc.

A technical recruiter from Meta recently reached out to say they’re hiring DEs (L4/L5) and invited me to begin technical interviews.

I’m torn on what decision would be best for my career: Should I pursue the opportunity at Meta, or stay in my current role and keep building?

Here are some things I’m weighing:

* Prestige: Having work experience at a company like Meta could open doors for me in the future.
* Tech stack: I’ve heard Meta uses mostly in-house tools (some open sourced), and I worry that might hurt future job transitions where industry-standard tools are more relevant.
* Role scope: I’ve read that DEs at Meta may do work closer to analytics engineering. I enjoy analytics, but I’d miss the more technical DE aspects.
* Compensation: I’m currently making \~$160K base + pre-IPO equity + bonus potential. Meta’s base range is similar, but equity would likely be more valuable and far lower risk.
* Location: My current role is entirely remote. I would have to relocate to accommodate Meta's hybrid in person requirement.

TLDR; how do you validate that you have all your data before letting the downstream module consume an aggregated topic or flush the period of aggregation from the stream ?",4,4,Commercial_Dig2401,2025-04-21 01:05:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k41dxp/streaming_how_do_you_know_if_things_are_complete/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-21 01:05:40,1,Monday,166.0,885,74.79,12,225,9.7,0,0
1k4p5gh,Storing multivariate time series in parquet for machine learning,"Hi, sorry this is a bit of a noob question. I have a few long time series I want to use for machine learning.

So e.g. x\_1 \~ t\_1, t\_2, ..., t\_billion

and i have just like 20 or something x

  
So intuitively I feel like it should be stored in a row oriented format since i can quickly search across the time indicies I want to use. Like I'd say I want all of the time series points at t = 20,345:20,400 to plug into ml. Instead of I want all the xs then pick out a specific index from each x.

I saw on a post around 8 months ago that parquet is the way to go. So parquet being a columnar format I thought maybe if I just transpose my series and try to save it, then it's fine.

But that made the write time go from 15 seconds (when I it's t row, and x time series) to 20+ minutes (I stopped the process after a while since I didn't know when it would end). So I'm not really sure what to do at this point. Maybe keep it as column format and keep re-reading the same rows each time? Or change to a different type of data storage?",3,2,Affectionate_Use9936,2025-04-21 21:26:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k4p5gh/storing_multivariate_time_series_in_parquet_for/,1,False,False,False,False,2025-04-21 21:26:23,21,Monday,213.0,1035,87.55,12,254,7.5,0,0
1k4hl3x,Thoughts on TOGAF vs CDMP certification,"Based on my research:

1. TOGAF seems to be the go-to for enterprise architecture and might give me a broader IT architecture framework. [TOGAF](https://www.opengroup.org/certifications/togaf-certification-portfolio?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
2. CDMP is more focused on data governance, metadata, and overall data management best practices. [CDMP](https://www.dama.org/cpages/cdmp-information?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

I’m a data engineer with a few certs already (Databricks, dbt) and looking to expand into more strategic roles—consulting, data architecture, etc. My company is paying for the certification, so price is not a factor.

Has anyone taken either of these certs?

* Which one did you find more practical or respected?
* Was one of them outdated material? Did you gain any value from it?
* Which one did clients or employers actually care about?
* How long did it take you and were there available study materials?

Would love to hear honest thoughts before spending the next couple of months on it haha! Or maybe there is another cert that is more valueable for learning architecture/data management?

1k4ij3v,Benchmark library for PostgreSQL,"Copy pasting text from LinkedIn post guys…

Long story short:
Over the course of my career, every time I had a query to test, I found myself spamming the “Run” button in DataGrip or re‑writing the same boilerplate code over and over again. After some Googling, I couldn’t find an easy‑to‑use PostgreSQL benchmarking library—so I wrote my own.
(Plus, `pgbenchmark` was such a good name that I couldn't resist writing a library for it)

It still has plenty of rough edges, but it’s extremely easy to use and packed with powerful features by design. Plus, it comes with a simple (but ugly) UI for ad‑hoc playground experiments.

Long way to go, but stay tuned and I'm ofc open for suggestions and feature requests :)

Why should you try `pgbenchmark`?

•  README is very user-friendly and easy to follow <3
• ⚙️ Zero configuration: Install, point at your database, and you’re ready to go
• 🗿 Template engine: Jinja2-like template engine to generate random queries on the fly
• 📊 Detailed results: Execution times, min-max-average-median, and percentile summaries  
• 📈 Built‑in UI: Spin up a simple, no‑BS playground to explore results interactively. [WIP]

1k5b6kr,Apache Airflow 3.0 is here – and it’s a big one!,"After months of work from the community, Apache Airflow 3.0 has officially landed and it marks a major shift in how we think about orchestration! 

This release lays the foundation for a more modern, scalable Airflow. Some of the most exciting updates:

* **Service-Oriented Architecture** – break apart the monolith and deploy only what you need
* **Asset-Based Scheduling** – define and track data objects natively
* **Event-Driven Workflows** – trigger DAGs from events, not just time
* **DAG Versioning** – maintain execution history across code changes
* **Modern React UI** – a completely reimagined web interface

I've been working on this one closely as a product manager at Astronomer and Apache contributor. It's been incredible to see what the community has built!

1k52jic,Forgetting basic parts of the stack over time,"I realized today that I've barely touched SQL in the last 2 years. I've done some basic queries in BigQuery on a few occasions. I recently wanted to do some JOINs on a personal project and realised I kinda suck at them and I actually had to refresh my knowledge on some basics related to HAVING, GROUP BY etc. It just wasn't a significant part of my work over the last 2 years. In fact I use some python scripts I made a long time ago for executing a series of statements so I almost completely erradicated using SQL from my day-to-day.


Sometimes I feel like I'd join a call with my colleagues or people more junior than me and they could pull up anything and start blasting away any type of code or chain of terminal commands from memory  - sometimes I feel like I'm a retired software engineer and a lot of these things are a distant memory to me that I have to refresh every time I need something.


Part of the ""problem"" is that I got abstracted from a lot of things with UI tools. I barely use the terminal for managing or navigating our cloud platform because the UI fits most of my needs, so I couldn't really help you check something in the cluster using the terminal without reading the docs. I also made some scripts for interacting with our cloud so I don't have to execute long commands in the terminal. I also use a GUI tool for  git so I couldn't help you rebase in the terminal without revising how the process goes in the terminal.


TL;DR I'm approaching 7 years in this career and I use various abstractions like GUI tools and custom scripts to make my life easier and I dont keep my knowledge fresh on basics.

1k57a40,Switching from a data science to data engineering: Good idea?,"Hello, a few months ago I graduated for a ""Data Science in Business"" MSc degree in France (Paris) and I started looking for a job as a Junior Data Scientist, I kept my options open by applying in different sectors, job types and regions in France, even in Europe in general as I am fluent in both French and English. Today, it's been almost 8 months since I started applying (even before I graduated), but without success. During my internship as a data scientist in the retail sector, I found myself doing some ""data engineering"" tasks like working a lot on the cloud (GCP) and doing a lot of SQL in Bigquery, I know it's not much compared to what a real data engineer does on his daily tasks, but it was a new thing for me and I enjoyed doing it. At the end of my internship, I learned that unlike internships in the US, where it's considered a trial period to get hired, here in France it's considered more like a way to get some work done for cheap... well, especially in big companies. I understand that it's not always like that, but that's what I've noticed from many students.

Anyway, during those few months after the internship, I started learning tools like Spark, AWS, and some of Airflow. I'm thinking that maybe I have a better chance to get a job in data engineering, because a lot of people say that it's getting harder and harder to find a job as a data scientist, especially for juniors. So is this a good idea for me? Because it's been like 3-4 months applying for Data Engineering jobs, still nothing. If so, is there more I need to learn? Or should I stick to Data Science profil, and look in other places, like Germany for example?

1k5ghoy,Iceberg in practice,"Noob questions incoming!

**Context:**   
I'm designing my project's storage and data pipelines, but am new to data engineering. I'm trying to understand the ins and outs of various solutions for the task of reading/writing diverse types of very large data.   
  
From a theoretical standpoint, I understand that Iceberg is a standard for organizing metadata about files. Metadata organized to the Iceberg standard allows for the creation of ""Iceberg tables"" that can be queried with a familiar SQL-like syntax.

I'm trying to understand how this would fit into a real world scenario... For example, lets say I use object storage, and there are a bunch of pre-existing parquet files and maybe some images in there. Could be anything...

**Question 1:**  
How is the metadata/tables initially generated for all this existing data? I know AWS has the Glue Crawler. Is something like that used? 

Or do you have to manually create the tables, and then somehow point the tables to the correct parquet files that contain the data associated with that table?

**Question 2:**  
Okay, now assume I have object storage and metadata/tables all generated for files in storage. Someone comes along and drops a new parquet file into some bucket. I'm assuming that I would need some orchestration utility that is monitoring my storage and kicking off some script to add the new data to the appropriate tables? Or is it done some other way?

**Question 3:**   
I assume that there are query engines out there that are implemented to the Iceberg standard for creating and reading Iceberg metadata/tables, and fetching data based on those tables. For example, I've read that SparkQL and Trino have Iceberg ""connectors"". So essentially the power of Iceberg can't be leveraged if your tech stack doesn't implement compliant readers/writers? How prolific are Iceberg compatible query engines?

1k4xmzt,Switching into SWE or MLE questions.,"Basically the title. I'm trying to get out of data engineering since it's just really boring and trivial to me for almost any task, and the ones that are hard are just really tedious. A lot of repetitive query writing and just overall not something I'm enjoying.

I've always enjoyed ML and distributed systems, so I think MLE would be a perfect fit for me. I have 2 YOE if you're only counting post graduation and 3 if you count internship. I know MLE may not be the ""perfect"" fit for researching models, but if I want to get into actual research for modern LLM models, I'd need to get a PhD, and I just don't have the drive for that.

Background: did UG at a top 200 public school. Doing MS at Georgia Tech with ML specialization. Should finish that in 2026 end of summer or end of fall depending if I want to take a 1 course semester for a break.

  
I guess my main question is whether it's easier to swap into MLE from DE directly or go SWE then MLE with the master's completion. I haven't been seriously applying since I recently (Jan 2025) started a new DE role (thinking it would be more interesting since it's FinTech instead of Healthcare, but it's still boring). I would like to hear others' experience swapping into MLE, and potential ways I could make myself more hirable. I would specifically like a remote role also if possible (not original) but I would definitely take the right role in person or hybrid if it was a good company and good comp with interesting stuff. To put in perspective I'm making about 95k + bonus right now, so I don't think my comp requirements are too high. 

I've also started applying to SWE roles just to see if something interesting comes up, but again just looking for advice / experience from others.

1k5c7sh,Are snowflake tasks the right choice for frequent dynamically changing SQL?,"I recently joined a new team that maintains an existing AWS Glue to Snowflake pipeline, and building another one.

The pattern that's been chosen is to use tasks that kick off stored procedures. There are some tasks that update Snowflake tables by running a SQL statement, and there are other tasks that updates those tasks whenever the SQL statement need to change. These changes are usually adding a new column/table and reading data in from a stream.

After a few months of working with this and testing, it seems clunky to use tasks like this. More I read, tasks should be used for more static infrequent changes. The clunky part is having to suspend the root task, update the child task and make sure the updated version is used when it runs, otherwise it wouldn't insert the new schema changes, and so on etc.

Is this the normal established pattern, or are there better ones?

I thought about maybe, instead of using tasks for the SQL, use a Snowflake table to store the SQL string?

I’m 6 months into learning Python, SQL and DE. 

For my current work (non-related to DE) I need to process an Excel file with 10k+ rows of product listings (boats, ATVs, snowmobiles) for a classifieds platform (like Craigslist/OLX). 

I already have about 10-15 scripts in Python I often use on that Excel file which made my work tremendously easier. And I thought it would be logical to make the whole process automated in a full pipeline with Airflow, normalization, validation, reporting etc.

Here’s my plan:

1. Extract:  
- load Excel (local or cloud) using pandas

2. Transform:  
- create a 3NF SQL DB
- validate data, check unique IDs, validate years columns, check for empty/broken data, check constency, data types fix invalid addresses etc)
- run obligatory business-logic scripts (validate addresses, duplicate rows if needed, check for dealerships and many more)
- query final rows via joins, export to data/transformed.xlsx

3. Load
   - upload final Excel via platform’s API
   - archive versioned files on my VPS

4. Report
   - send Telegram message with row counts, category/address summaries, Matplotlib graphs, and attached Excel.  
   - error logs for validation failures

5. Testing
   - pytest unit tests for each stage (e.g., Excel parsing, normalization, API uploads).  

Planning to use Airflow to manage the pipeline as a DAG, with tasks for each ETL stage and retries for API failures but didn’t think that through yet.

As experienced data engineers what strikes you first as bad design or bad idea here? How can I improve it as a project for my portfolio?

This isn’t a complaint or a gatekeeping rant—I love how accessible the tech industry has become. Bootcamps, online resources, and community content have opened doors for so many people. But at the same time, I can’t help but feel that the role is being diluted.

What once required a solid foundation in Computer Science—data structures, algorithms, systems design, software engineering principles—has increasingly become something you can “learn” in a few weeks. The job often gets reduced to moving data from point A to point B, orchestrating some tools, and calling it a day. And that’s fine on the surface—until you realize that many of these pipelines lack test coverage, versioning discipline, clear modularity, or even basic error handling.

Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe this is exactly what democratization looks like, and it’s a good thing. But I do wonder: are we trading depth for speed? And if so, what happens to the long-term quality of the systems we build?

1k66f2e,"Are Delta tables a good option for high volume, real-time data?","Hey everyone, I was doing a POC with Delta tables for a real-time data pipeline and started doubting if Delta even is a good fit for high-volume, real-time data ingestion. 

Here’s the scenario: 
- We're consuming data from multiple Kafka topics (about 5), each representing a different stage in an event lifecycle. 

- Data is ingested every 60 seconds with small micro-batches. (we cannot tweak the micro batch frequency much as near real-time data is a requirement)

- We’re using Delta tables to store and upsert the data based on unique keys, and we’ve partitioned the table by date. 


While Delta provides great features like ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel, I’m running into issues with table bloat. Despite only having a few days’ worth of data, the table size is growing rapidly, and optimization commands aren’t having the expected effect. 

From what I’ve read, Delta can handle real-time data well, but there are some challenges that I'm facing in particular:
- File fragmentation: Delta writes new files every time there’s a change, which is result in many  files and inefficient storage (around 100-110 files per partition - table partitioned by date). 

- Frequent Upserts: In this real-time system where data is constantly updated, Delta is ending up rewriting large portions of the table at high frequency, leading to excessive disk usage. 

- Performance: For very high-frequency writes, the merge process is becoming slow, and the table size is growing quickly without proper maintenance. 

To give some facts on the POC: The realtime data ingestion to delta ran for 24 hours full, the physical accumulated was 390 GB, the count of rows was 110 million.

The main outcome of this POC for me was that there's a ton of storage overhead as the data size stacks up extremely fast!

For reference, the overall objective for this setup is to be able to perform near real time analytics on this data and use the data for ML.

Has anyone here worked with Delta tables for high-volume, real-time data pipelines? Would love to hear your thoughts on whether they’re a good fit for such a scenario or not.

- Dashboards don’t cover flexible needs, so it’s always a back-and-forth of “can you pull this?”
- Game telemetry split across client/web/iOS/Android/brands—each with different behavior and screen sizes.
- Streaming rewards and matchmaking in real time sounds cool—until you’re debugging Flink queues and job delays at 2AM.
- Our big data stack looked “simple” on paper but turned into a maintenance monster: Kafka, Flink, Spark, MySQL, ZooKeeper, Airflow… all duct-taped together.

We once worked with a top-10 game where even a 50-person data team took 2–3 days to handle most requests. 

And don’t even get me started on security. With so many layers, if something breaks, good luck finding the root cause before business impact hits.

So my question to you:
Has anyone here actually simplified their data pipeline for gaming workloads?
What worked, what didn’t?

1k5xk1r,Excel-based listings file into an ETL pipeline,"Hey r/dataengineering,

I’m 6 months into learning Python, SQL and DE.

For my current work (non-related to DE) I need to process an Excel file with 10k+ rows of product listings (boats, ATVs, snowmobiles) for a classifieds platform (like Craigslist/OLX).

I already have about 10-15 scripts in Python I often use on that Excel file which made my work tremendously easier. And I thought it would be logical to make the whole process automated in a full pipeline with Airflow, normalization, validation, reporting etc.

Here’s my plan:

**Extract**

- load Excel (local or cloud) using pandas

**Transform**

- create a 3NF SQL DB

- validate data, check unique IDs, validate years columns, check for empty/broken data, check constency, data types fix invalid addresses etc)

- run obligatory business-logic scripts (validate addresses, duplicate rows if needed, check for dealerships and many more)

- query final rows via joins, export to data/transformed.xlsx

**Load**

- upload final Excel via platform’s API
- archive versioned files on my VPS

**Report**

- send Telegram message with row counts, category/address summaries, Matplotlib graphs, and attached Excel
- error logs for validation failures

**Testing**

- pytest unit tests for each stage (e.g., Excel parsing, normalization, API uploads).

Planning to use Airflow to manage the pipeline as a DAG, with tasks for each ETL stage and retries for API failures but didn’t think that through yet.

As experienced data engineers what strikes you first as bad design or bad idea here? How can I improve it as a project for my portfolio?

1k61n2x,Surrogate Key Implementation In Glue and Redshift,"I am currently implementing a Data Warehouse using Glue and Redshift, a star schema dimensional model to be exact. 

  
And I think of the data transformations, that need to be done before having the clean fact and dimension tables in the data warehouse, as two types:

  
\* Transformations related to the logic or business itself, eg. drop irrelevant columns, create new columns etc,   
 \* Transformations that are purely related to the structure of a table, eg. the surrogate key column, the foreign key columns that we need to add to fact tables, etc  
For the second type, from what I understood from mt research, it can be done in Glue or Redshift, but apparently it will be more complicated to do it in Glue?  

Take the example of surrogate keys, they will be Primary keys later on, and therefore if we will generate them in Glue, we have to ensure their uniqueness, this is feasible for the same job run, but if you want to ensure uniqueness across the entire table, you need to load the entire surrogate key column from Redshift and ensure that the newly generated ones in the job are unique.  


I find this type of question recurrent in almost everything related to the structure of the data warehouse, from surrogate keys, to foreign keys, to SCD type 2.

1k6fbra,University Advice?  Data Science + Global Studies or Chinese Language Major || Double Major (Maybe Even Triple?),"I'm coming into college for Fall 25  originally intending to major in Global Studies and Chinese Language. My original desire was to work for The State Department in some capacity, and to be a subject matter expert in Chinese Affairs - potentially in the Diplomatic Security Service, or as an analyst for the FBI/CIA, etc - something where I can serve the US.

I didn't expect to get into Cal, and this changed everything for me, I suddenly feel emboldened to reach out of my comfort level - and I excelled in statistics and enjoyed the class in HS over 10 years ago. Data Science seems like a great fit, and the career opportunities are very appealing after talking to a few of my peers in the field. It's also something that the State Department / FBI / CIA / etc. would need. I'm going to take all the courses needed to declare the major (Data C8, Calc 1, Calc 2, etc) and do a comprehensive review.

  
I feel like there's a lot of overlap in Global Studies / Chinese Language, which is why I had it as my original double major goal.   
Just looking at the requirements is making it clear I'll easily bust the 136 or so credit course limit for transfer students. Even without the credit limit, the Semesters will be extremely rigorous. 

So I'm thinking of ""just"" choosing either Global Studies or Chinese Language. I can see pros/cons to both. In a perfect world, I would Triple Major. I would love to be a diplomat, and discuss global policy and implications of policy decisions. An advisor in told me I could still do that without taking Global Studies classes, and I would have more expertise and knowledge if I studied Chinese Language as a Major.

Any input?

1k6141q,Ever wondered about the real cost of browser-based scraping at scale?,"I’ve been diving deep into the costs of running browser-based scraping at scale, and I wanted to share some insights on what it takes to run 1,000 browser requests, comparing commercial solutions to self-hosting (DIY). This is based on some research I did, and I’d love to hear your thoughts, tips, or experiences scaling your own scraping setups.

# Why Use Browsers for Scraping?

Browsers are often essential for two big reasons:

* **JavaScript Rendering**: Many modern websites rely on JavaScript to load content. Without a browser, you’re stuck with raw HTML that might not show the data you need.
* **Avoiding Detection**: Raw HTTP requests can scream “bot” to websites, increasing the chance of bans. Browsers mimic human behavior, helping you stay under the radar and reduce proxy churn.

The downside? Running browsers at scale can get expensive fast. So, what’s the actual cost of 1,000 browser requests?

# Commercial Solutions: The Easy Path

Commercial JavaScript rendering services handle the browser infrastructure for you, which is great for speed and simplicity. I looked at high-volume pricing from several providers (check the blog link below for specifics). On average, costs for 1,000 requests range from \~$0.30 to $0.80, depending on the provider and features like proxy support or premium rendering options.

These services are plug-and-play, but I wondered if rolling my own setup could be cheaper. Spoiler: it often is, if you’re willing to put in the work.

# Self-Hosting: The DIY Route

To get a sense of self-hosting costs, I focused on running browsers in the cloud, excluding proxies for now (those are a separate headache). The main cost driver is your cloud provider. For this analysis, I assumed each browser needs \~2GB RAM, 1 CPU, and takes \~10 seconds to load a page.

# Option 1: Serverless Functions

Serverless platforms (like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, etc.) are great for handling bursts of requests, but cold starts can be a pain, anywhere from 2 to 15 seconds, depending on the provider. You’re also charged for the entire time the function is active. Here’s what I found for 1,000 requests:

* Typical costs range from \~$0.24 to $0.52, with cheaper options around $0.24–$0.29 for providers with lower compute rates.

# Option 2: Virtual Servers

Virtual servers are more hands-on but can be significantly cheaper—often by a factor of \~3. I looked at machines with 4GB RAM and 2 CPUs, capable of running 2 browsers simultaneously. Costs for 1,000 requests:

* Prices range from \~$0.08 to $0.12, with the lowest around $0.08–$0.10 for budget-friendly providers.

**Pro Tip**: Committing to long-term contracts (1–3 years) can cut these costs by 30–50%.

For a detailed breakdown of how I calculated these numbers, check out the full blog post here (replace with your actual blog link).

# When Does DIY Make Sense?

To figure out when self-hosting beats commercial providers, I came up with a rough formula:

    (commercial price - your cost) × monthly requests ≤ 2 × engineer salary

* **Commercial price**: Assume \~$0.36/1,000 requests (a rough average).
* **Your cost**: Depends on your setup (e.g., \~$0.24/1,000 for serverless, \~$0.08/1,000 for virtual servers).
* **Engineer salary**: I used \~$80,000/year (rough average for a senior data engineer).
* **Requests**: Your monthly request volume.

For serverless setups, the breakeven point is around \~108 million requests/month (\~3.6M/day). For virtual servers, it’s lower, around \~48 million requests/month (\~1.6M/day). So, if you’re scraping 1.6M–3.6M requests *per day*, self-hosting might save you money. Below that, commercial providers are often easier, especially if you want to:

* Launch quickly.
* Focus on your core project and outsource infrastructure.

**Note**: These numbers don’t include proxy costs, which can increase expenses and shift the breakeven point.

# Key Takeaways

Scaling browser-based scraping is all about trade-offs. Commercial solutions are fantastic for getting started or keeping things simple, but if you’re hitting millions of requests daily, self-hosting can save you a lot if you’ve got the engineering resources to manage it. At high volumes, it’s worth exploring both options or even negotiating with providers for better rates.

1k6e50x,An automation work flow is not an ai agents,"  
**Connecting GPT with Zapier doesn’t mean you’ve created a smart agent**

A lot of people think they have ""smart agents"" just by linking GPT with Zapier, but the truth is, what you have is simply **automation**. It follows a set sequence of steps, doesn't understand the objective, and doesn’t interact with any complex context.

But there's another level of **AI Agents**, and it’s something entirely different. **Real AI Agents** understand the environment they’re working in. They don't just follow orders; they comprehend intent, make decisions based on variables, and operate like you’ve hired a smart person who works autonomously.

**What can AI Agents do?**  
They’re more than just automation tools. They’re “internet robots” that can perform ANY task you need without mistakes, tirelessly working around the clock. Here’s what they can do:

* Build massive email lists
* Manage social media accounts
* Create and maintain websites
* Perform any service you need and deliver money!

**Does this sound too good to be true?**  
It’s not. AI Agents are real, and they’re changing everything. **Do you need tech skills?**  
No! The great thing is that these agents can work efficiently without the need for advanced technical knowledge.

**Are we at the beginning of something big?**  
Yes! This is the perfect time to get involved before this technology becomes mainstream and disrupts the job market. In the future, these agents will become an integral part of working online.

1k7214y,Feedback on two rough draft architectures made by a noob.,"I am a SWE with no DE experience. I have been tasked with architecting our storage and ETL pipelines. I took a month long online course leading up to my start date, and have done a ton of research and asked you guys a lot of questions (**thank you!!**). 

All of this study/research has led me to two rough draft architectures to present to my company. I was hoping to get some constructive feedback on them, if you all would do me the honor. 

Here's some context for the images below:

1. Scale of data is many terabytes to a few petabytes uncompressed. Largely sensor data. 
2. Data is initially generated and stored on an air-gapped network. 
3. Data will be moved into a lab by detaching hard-drives. There, we will need to retain some raw data for regulatory purposes, and we will also want to perform ETL into an analytical database/warehouse. 

I have a lot of time to refine these before implementation time, and specific technologies are flexible. but next week I wan to present a *reasonable* view of the types of solutions we might use.  What do you think of this as a first draft? Any obvious show stoppers or bad ideas here?

1k6xfby,Query runs longer than your AWS bill. How do I improve it,"Hey folks,

So I have this query that joins two table, selects a few columns, runs a dense rank and then filters to keep only the rank 1s. Pretty simple right ?

Here’s the kicker. The overpaid, under evolved nit wit who designed the databases didn’t add a single index on either of these tables. Both of which have upwards of 10M records. So, this simple query takes upwards of 90 mins to run and return a result set of 90K records. Unacceptable. 

So, I set out to right this cosmic wrong. My genius idea was to simplify the query to only perform the join and select the required columns. Eliminate the dense rank calculation and filtering. I would then read the data into Polars and then perform the same operations.

Yes, seems weird but here’s the reasoning. I’m accessing the data from a Tibco Data Virtualization layer. And the TDV docs themselves admit that running analytical functions on TDV causes a major performance hit. So it kinda makes sense to eliminate the analytical function. 

And it worked. Kind of. The time to read in the data from the DB was around 50 minutes. And Polars ran the dense rank and filtering in a matter of seconds. So, the total run time dropped to around half, even though I’m transferring a lot more data. Decent trade off in my book. 

But the problem is, I’m still not satisfied. I feel like there should be more I can do. I’d appreciate any suggestions and I’d be happy to provide any additional details. Thanks.

1k6zbhh,Best approach to warehousing flats,"I have about 20 years worth of flat files stored in a folder on a network drive as a result of lackluster data practices. Essentially, three different flat files get printed to this folder on a nightly bases that represent three different types of data (think: person, sales, products). Essentially this data could exist as three separate long tables with date as key. 

I'd like to establish a proper data warehouse, but am unsure of how to best handle the process of warehousing these flats. I have been interfacing with the data through Python Pandas so far, but the company has a SQL server...It would probably be best to place the warehouse as a database on the server, then pull/manipulate the data from there? But what is tripping me up is the order of operations to perform in the warehousing procedure. I don't believe I would be able to dump into SQL server without profiling the data first as number of columns and the type of data stored in the flat files may have changed throughout the years.



I am essentially struggling with how to sequence the process of : network drive flats > sql server db:

  
My concerns are:

Best method to profile the data?

Best way to store the metadata?

Throw flats into SQL server and then query them from there to perform data transformations/validations? 

  \-- It seems without knowing the meta data, I should perform this step in Pandas first before loading into SQL server? What is the best practice for that? perform operations on each flat file separately or combine first (e.g., should I clean the data during the loop or after combining tables)?

   \-- Right now, I am creating a list of flat files, using that list to create a dictionary of dataframes, and then using that dictionary to create a dataframe of dataframes to group and concatenate into 3 long tables -- am I convoluting this process?

How to approach data cleaning/validation/and additional column calculations? e.g. -- Should I perform these procedures on each file separately before concatenating into a long table or perform these procedures after concatenation?-- Should I even concatenate into longs or keep them separate and define a relationship to their keys stored in a separate table?

How many databases for this process? One for raws? One for staging? A third as the datawarehouse to be queried?

When to stage and how much of the process to perform in RAM/behind the scenes before printing to a new table?

Should I consider compressing the data at any point in the process? (e.g. store as Parquet)



The data gets used for data analytics and to assemble reports/dashboards. Ideally, I would like to eliminate having to perform as many joins as possible during the querying for analysis process. I'd also like to orchestrate the warehouse so that adjustments only need to happen in a single place and propagate throughout the pipeline with a history of adjustments stored as record.",3,2,Kate-WeHaveToGoBack,2025-04-24 18:18:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k6zbhh/best_approach_to_warehousing_flats/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-24 18:18:34,18,Thursday,495.0,2921,62.17,28,730,11.1,0,0

1k6j6ay,Scope of data engineering,"A few years ago I worked on a project that involved running distributed computations on a spark cluster (AWS ec2 machines). The data was pulled from data sources (CSV files in S3) and transformed and stored in parquet files, which were then fed in the computation engine running on spark, the output of which was mostly stored in a transactional database. The transactional db in turn powered a user interface.  

The computation engine ran as a job in the pipeline (processing high volume data) as well as upon user actions on the UI (low volume calculations). This computation engine was pretty complex component, doing a bunch of different things. Given the complexity, there was a strong need to have a properly structured code that stays maintainable, as a large team worked just on this. Also as this was the slowest component of the pipeline, there was also a need to be well versed in how spark works internally, so that well optimized code is written. The codebase was in scala.

My question is - does this component come under the purview of a data engineer or a software engineer.

1k7475r,How to assess the quality of written feedback/ comments given my managers.,"
I have the feedback/comments given by managers from the past two years (all levels).

My organization already has an LLM model. They want me to analyze these feedbacks/comments and come up with a framework containing dimensions such as clarity, specificity, and areas for improvement. The problem is how to create the logic from these subjective things to train the LLM model (the idea is to create a dataset of feedback). How should I approach this?

I have tried LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), which has various word libraries for each dimension and simply checks those words in the comments to give a rating. But this is not working.

Currently, only word count seems to be the only quantitative parameter linked with feedback quality (longer comments = better quality).

However, we’ve run into issues with real-time ingestion.

This is especially problematic since some of our data (like blocks and transactions) needs to be available in real-time, with query latency under 100ms.

To manage this better, we’re considering separating our ingestion strategy: keeping batch ingestion into ClickHouse for historical and analytical needs, while finding a way to access fresh data in real-time when needed — particularly for the GraphQL layer.

1k72yym,Why does Trino baseline specs are so extreme? isn't it overkill?,"Hi, i'm currently swapping my company data warehouse to a more modular solution using, among other things, a data lake.

I'm using Trino to set up a cluster and using it to connect to my AWS glue catalog and access my data on S3 buckets.

So, while setting Trino up, i was looking at their docs and some forum answers, and why does everywhere i look, people suggest ludicrous powerful machines as a baseline for trino? People recomend 64GB m5.4xlarge as a baseline for EACH worker? saying stuff like ""200GB should be enough for a starting point"".

I get it, Trino might be a really good solution for big datasets, and some bigger companies might just not care about expending 5k USD monthly only on EC2. But a smaller company with 4 employees, a startup, specially one located on other regions beyond us-east, simply saying you need 5x 4xlarge instances is, well, a lot...  
(for comparison, in my country, 5kUSD pays the salary of all members of the team and cover most of our other costs. and we have above average salaries for staff engineers...)  
  
I initially set my Trino cluster up with a 8gb ram machine and workers with 4 gb (t3.large and t3.medium on aws Ec2) and trino is actually working well, I have a 2TB dataset, which for many, is actually enough space.

Am I missing something? Is Trino bad as a simple solution for something like simply replacing athena queries costs and having more control over my data? Should i be looking somewhere else? Or is this just simply a problem of ""usually companies have a bigger budget?""

How can i get what is really a minimum baseline for using it?

I’m trying to work on a new project to improve my data engineering skills and would love to get some advice from people more experienced in real-world systems.

# 🔁 What I’m Trying to Do:

I previously built a Medallion Architecture project using MongoDB, Pandas, and PostgreSQL (Bronze → Silver → Gold). It helped me understand the basics of ELT pipelines.

Now I want to do something different, so I’m trying to build a **real-time pipeline** that also uses **graph modeling**. Here’s my rough idea:

* Use **MongoDB Atlas** to store real-time event data (e.g., product views, purchases)
* Use **AWS Lambda** to process/clean those events.
* Push the cleaned events into **Neo4j** to create user-product relationships (for example: `(:User)-[:VIEWED]->(:Product)`)

I’d also like to simulate the stream using Python + Faker, just to have some data coming in regularly.

# 🙋‍♂️ Where I’m Stuck / Need Help:

1. **Is it even a good idea to combine MongoDB and Neo4j like this?** Or should I focus on just one?
2. Are there any common mistakes or traps I should watch out for with this kind of setup?
3. Any suggestions on making it more realistic or structured like a production system?

I’m using Snowflake for our data warehouse and just recently got our team set up with Git/source control. Now we’re looking to roll out either dbt or SQLMesh for transformations (I've been able to sell the team on its value as it's something I've seen work very well in another company I worked at).

One of the biggest unknowns (and requirements the team has) is tracking column-level lineage across dbt/SQLMesh and Power BI.

Essentially, I want to find a way to use a DAG (and/or testing on a pipeline) to track dependencies so that we can assess how upstream database changes might impact reports in Power BI.

For example: if an employee opens a pull/merge request in GIT to modify TABLE X (change/delete a column), running a command like 'dbt run' (crude example, I know) would build everything downstream and trigger a warning that the column they removed/changed is used in a Power BI report.

Important: it has to be at a column level. Model level is good to start but we'll need both.

Has anyone found good ways to manage this?

1k7nb1b,Optimizing a Debezium Mongo source connector,"Hey all!I hope everyone here is doing great.I'm running some performance benchmarks for the Mongo connector and comparing it against another tool that I'm already using. Given my limited experience with Debezium's Mongo connector, I thought I'd ask for some ideas around tuning it.:)

The test is set up so that Kafka Connect, Mongo and Kafka are run as containers. Once a connector (or generally a pipeline) is created, the Kafka destination topic is monitored for throughput. This particular test focuses on CDC (there's another one for snapshots) and is using Kafka Connect 7.8 and Mongo connector 3.1.

I went through all the properties in the Mongo connector and tuned those that I thought made sense tuning. Those are:

  
`""key.converter.schemas.enable"": false,`  
`""value.converter.schemas.enable"": false,`  
  
`""key.converter"": ""org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter"",`  
`""value.converter"": ""org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter"",`  
  
`""max.batch.size"": 64000,`  
`""max.queue.size"": 128000,`

`""producer.override.batch.size"": 1000000`

The full configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/ConduitIO/streaming-benchmarks/blob/df8dc6f5dc05a48eb15ee3e9518d2080cf90210e/benchmarks/mongo-kafka-cdc/kafka-connect-dbz/data/connector.json).

Additionally I've set the Kafka Connect worker's heap to 10 GB. The whole test is run on EC2 (on an instance with 8 vCPUs and 32 GiB of memory).

1k7hxii,Delta Load Into an Enrichment Layer,"Hello!   
  
I have a bit challenging question about how to design a datapipeline. 

I use databricks to handle the movement and transformation from schema to schema (layer). I use a raw schema where table resides with standard columns such as business\_valid\_from, business\_valid\_to, and for bi-temporality these tables also have applied\_valid\_from and applied\_valid\_to.

I am about to extract data from these raw tables into my enrichment layer where I wish to join and transform 2 or more tables into 1 table.

I only wish to extract the last changed data from the raw vault (delta load) since last extract (timestamp determined either by the max date in encrichment table or the last runtime in a metadata table). 

What I find difficult is fx if I have 2 tables (table\_a and table\_b) that I need to extract new data from. Then I need to ensure that if table\_a has a changed row from 1 week ago and table\_b does does not have changed row from 1 week ago - then I will get rows from table\_a but none from table\_b and when I join these two tables then table\_a will not get any data from table\_b (either null or no rows if I use inner join).

How can I ensure that if table\_a has updated/changed rows  from some time back then I will also could find these 'joinable' rows in table\_b even if these rows has not been updated?

(extra note on this)  
Before anyone says that I need to delta load each table separately and deterimine what business dates that will be needed for all tables - then please know I have already done that. That solution is not great because there is always some row that has been updated, and that row has a business\_valid\_from long ago fx 2012. This would result in a long list of business days that will be needed for all table - and then it defeats the purpose of the delta load.

1k8k8s8,This environment would be a real nightmare for me.,"YouTube released some interesting metrics for their 20 year celebration and their data environment is just insane.

- Processing infrastructure handling 20+ million daily video uploads 
- Storage and retrieval systems managing 20+ billion total videos
- Analytics pipelines tracking 3.5+ billion daily likes and 100+ million daily comments
- Real-time processing of engagement metrics (creator-hearted comments reaching 10 million daily)
- Infrastructure supporting multimodal data types (video, audio, comments, metadata)

From an analytics point of view, it would be extremely difficult to validate anything you build in this environment, especially if it's something that is very obscure. 
Supposed they calculate a ""Content Stickiness Factor"" (a metric which quantifies how much a video prevents users from leaving the platform), 
how would anyone validate that a factor of 0.3 is correct for creator X? That is just for 1 creator in one segment, there are different segments which all have different behaviors eg podcasts which might be longer vs shorts

I would assume training ml models, or basic queries would be either slow or very expensive which punishes mistakes a lot. You either run 10 computer for 10 days or or 2000 computers for 1.5 hours, and if you forget that 2000 computer cluster running, for just a few minutes for lunch maybe, or worse over the weekend, you will come back to regret it.

Any mistakes you do are amplified by the amount of data, you omitting a single ""LIMIT 10"" or use a ""SELECT * "" in the wrong place and you could easy cost the company millions of dollars.
""Forgot a single cluster running, well you just lost us $10 million dollars buddy""

And because of these challenges, l believe such an environment demands excellence, not to ensure that no one makes mistakes, but to prevent obvious ones and reduce the probability of catastrophic ones.

l am very curious how such an environment is managed and would love to see it someday.

I have gotten to a point in my career where l have to start thinking about things like this, so can anyone who has worked in this kind of environment share tips of how to design an environment like this to make it ""safer"" to work in.

1k8jmbo,Are we missing the point of data catalogs? Why don't they control data access too?,"Hi there, 

I've been thinking about the current generation of data catalogs like DataHub and OpenMetadata, and something doesn't add up for me. They do a great job tracking metadata, but stop short of doing what seems like the next obvious step, actually helping enforce data access policies.

Imagine a unified catalog that isn't just a metadata registry, but also the gatekeeper to data itself:

- Roles defined at the catalog level map directly to roles and grants on underlying sources through credential-vending.

- Every access, by a user or a pipeline, goes through the catalog first, creating a clean audit trail.

Iceberg’s REST catalog hints at this model: it stores table metadata and acts as a policy-enforcing access layer, managing credentials for the object storage underneath.

Why not generalize this idea to all structured and unstructured data? Instead of just listing a MySQL table or an S3 bucket of PDFs, the catalog would also vend credentials to access them. Instead of relying on external systems for access control, the catalog becomes the control plane.

This would massively improve governance, observability, and even simplify pipeline security models.

Is there any OSS project trying to do this today?

Are there reasons (technical or architectural) why projects like DataHub and OpenMetadata avoid owning the access control space?

Would you find it valuable to have a catalog that actually controls access, not just documents it?

I’m also considering taking a minor in statistics, and I want to set myself up for success in Data Engineering once I graduate. Given my situation, what advice would you offer? I’m not sure if a Master’s is useful in the field, or if a PhD is important. Are there majors which would make me better equipped for the field, and how can I set myself up best to get an internship for Summer 2026? My current workplace has told me frequently that I would likely have a full-time offer waiting when I graduate if I’m interested.

1k8jz47,Should we use SCD Type 1 instead of Type 2 for our DWH when analytics only needs current data?,"# Our Current Data Pipeline

* PostgreSQL OLTP database as source
* Data pipeline moves data to BigQuery at different frequencies:
   * Critical tables: hourly
   * Less critical tables: daily
* Two datasets in BigQuery:
   * **Raw dataset**: Always appends new data (similar to SCD Type 2 but without surrogate keys, current flags, or valid\_to dates)
   * **Clean dataset**: Only contains latest data from raw dataset

# Our Planned Revamp

We're implementing dimensional modeling to create proper OLAP tables.

**Original plan:**

1. Create DBT snapshots (SCD Type 2) from raw dataset
2. Build dimension and fact tables from these snapshots

**Problem:**

* SCD Type 2 implementation is resource-intensive
* Causes full table scans in BigQuery (expensive)
* Requires complex joins and queries

# The Reality of Our Analytics Needs

* Analytics team **only uses latest data** for insights
* Historical change tracking isn't currently used
* Raw dataset already exists if historical analysis is needed in rare cases

# Our Potential Solution

Instead of creating snapshots, we plan to:

* Skip the SCD Type 2 snapshot process entirely
* Build dimension tables (SCD Type 1) directly from our raw tables
* Leverage the fact that our raw tables already implement a form of SCD Type 2 (they contain historical data through append-only inserts)
* Update dimensions with latest data only

This approach would:

* Reduce complexity
* Lower BigQuery costs
* Match current analytics usage patterns
* Still allow historical access via raw dataset if needed

# Questions

1. Is our approach to implement SCD Type 1 reasonable given our specific use case?
2. What has your experience been if you've faced similar decisions?
3. Are there drawbacks to this approach we should consider?

1k890ay,How to handle faulty records coming in to be able to report on DQ?,"I work on a data platform and currently we have several new ingestions coming in Databricks, Medallion architecture. 

I asked the 2 incoming sources to fill in table schema which contains column name, description, data type, primary key and constraints. Most important are data types and constraints in terms of tracking valid and invalid records. 

We are cureently at the stage to start tracking dq across the whole platform. So i am wondering what is the best way to start with this?

I had the idea to ingest everythig as is to bronze layer. Then before going to silver, check if recoeds are following the data shema, are constraints met (f.e. values within specified ranges, formatting of timestamps etc). If there are records which do not meet these rules, i was thinking about putting them to quarantine. 

My question, how to quarantine them? And if there are faulty records found, should we immediately alert the source or only if a certain percentage of records are faulty?

Also should we add another column in silver 'valid' which would signify if the record is meeting the table schema and constraints defined? So that would be the way to use this column and report on % of faulty records which could be a part of a DQ dashboard?

I found that having it makes it way simpler at first because downstream models only have to select from the filtered table to have what they need without issues. But as time flys you end up with 50 subset tables of the same thing which is not that good.

And if you don’t then you see that the same filters are reused over and over again but also that this generates issues if for example downstream models should look for 2 field for validity like ‘where country = xyz AND is_active’.

So do you usually filter by types or not ? Or do you filter by active and non active records?

1k93nf9,General guidance - Docker/dagster/postgres ETL build,"Hello

I need a sanity check.

I am educated and work in an unrelated field to DE. My IT experience comes from a pure layman interest in the subject where I have spent some time dabbing in python building scrapers, setting up RDBs, building scripts to connect everything and then building extraction scripts to do analysis. Ive done some scripting at work to automate annoying tasks. That said, I still consider myself a beginner.

At my workplace we are a bunch of consultants doing work mostly in excel, where we get lab data from external vendors. This lab data is then to be used in spatial analysis and comparison against regulatory limits. 

I have now identified 3-5 different ways this data is delivered to us, i.e. ways it could be ingested to a central DB. Its a combination of APIs, emails attachments, instrument readings, GPS outputs and more. Thus, Im going to try to get a very basic ETL pipeline going for at least one of these delivery points which is the easiest, an API.

Because of the way our company has chosen to operate, because we dont really have a fuckton of data and the data we have can be managed in separate folders based on project/work, we have servers on premise. We also have some beefy computers used for computations in a server room. So i could easily set up more computers to have scripts running. 

My plan is to get a old computer up and running 24/7 in one of the racks. This computer will host docker+dagster connected to a postgres db. When this is set up il spend time building automated extraction scripts based on workplace needs. I chose dagster here because it seems to be free in our usecase, modular enought that i can work on one job at a time and its python friendly. Dagster also makes it possible for me to write loads to endpoint users who are not interested in writing sql against the db.  Another important thing with the db on premise is that its going to be connected to GIS software, and i dont want to build a bunch of scripts to extract from it.

Some of the questions i have:

* If i run docker and dagster (dagster web service?) setup locally, could that cause any security issues? Its my understanding that if these are run locally they are contained within the network
* For a small ETL pipeline like this, is the setup worth it? 
* Am i missing anything?

1k9fcmb,[Feedback Request] A reactive computation library for Python that might be helpful for data science workflows - thoughts from experts?,"Hey!

I recently built a Python library called [reaktiv](https://github.com/buiapp/reaktiv) that implements reactive computation graphs with automatic dependency tracking. I come from IoT and web dev (worked with Angular), so I'm definitely not an expert in data science workflows.

This is my first attempt at creating something that might be useful outside my specific domain, and I'm genuinely not sure if it solves real problems for folks in your field. I'd love some honest feedback - even if that's ""this doesn't solve any problem I actually have.""

The library creates a computation graph that:

* Only recalculates values when dependencies actually change
* Automatically detects dependencies at runtime
* Caches computed values until invalidated
* Handles asynchronous operations (built for asyncio)

While it seems useful to me, I might be missing the mark completely for actual data science work. If you have a moment, I'd appreciate your perspective.

Here's a simple example with pandas and numpy that might resonate better with data science folks:

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from reaktiv import signal, computed, effect
    
    # Base data as signals
    df = signal(pd.DataFrame({
        'temp': [20.1, 21.3, 19.8, 22.5, 23.1],
        'humidity': [45, 47, 44, 50, 52],
        'pressure': [1012, 1010, 1013, 1015, 1014]
    }))
    features = signal(['temp', 'humidity'])  # which features to use
    scaler_type = signal('standard')  # could be 'standard', 'minmax', etc.
    
    # Computed values automatically track dependencies
    selected_features = computed(lambda: df()[features()])
    
    # Data preprocessing that updates when data OR preprocessing params change
    def preprocess_data():
        data = selected_features()
        scaling = scaler_type()
        
        if scaling == 'standard':
            # Using numpy for calculations
            return (data - np.mean(data, axis=0)) / np.std(data, axis=0)
        elif scaling == 'minmax':
            return (data - np.min(data, axis=0)) / (np.max(data, axis=0) - np.min(data, axis=0))
        else:
            return data
    
    normalized_data = computed(preprocess_data)
    
    # Summary statistics recalculated only when data changes
    stats = computed(lambda: {
        'mean': pd.Series(np.mean(normalized_data(), axis=0), index=normalized_data().columns).to_dict(),
        'median': pd.Series(np.median(normalized_data(), axis=0), index=normalized_data().columns).to_dict(),
        'std': pd.Series(np.std(normalized_data(), axis=0), index=normalized_data().columns).to_dict(),
        'shape': normalized_data().shape
    })
    
    # Effect to update visualization or logging when data changes
    def update_viz_or_log():
        current_stats = stats()
        print(f""Data shape: {current_stats['shape']}"")
        print(f""Normalized using: {scaler_type()}"")
        print(f""Features: {features()}"")
        print(f""Mean values: {current_stats['mean']}"")
    
    viz_updater = effect(update_viz_or_log)  # Runs initially
    
    # When we add new data, only affected computations run
    print(""\nAdding new data row:"")
    df.update(lambda d: pd.concat([d, pd.DataFrame({
        'temp': [24.5], 
        'humidity': [55], 
        'pressure': [1011]
    })]))
    # Stats and visualization automatically update
    
    # Change preprocessing method - again, only affected parts update
    print(""\nChanging normalization method:"")
    scaler_type.set('minmax')
    # Only preprocessing and downstream operations run
    
    # Change which features we're interested in
    print(""\nChanging selected features:"")
    features.set(['temp', 'pressure'])
    # Selected features, normalization, stats and viz all update

I think this approach might be particularly valuable for data science workflows - especially for:

* Building exploratory data pipelines that efficiently update on changes
* Creating reactive dashboards or monitoring systems that respond to new data
* Managing complex transformation chains with changing parameters
* Feature selection and hyperparameter experimentation
* Handling streaming data processing with automatic propagation

As data scientists, would this solve any pain points you experience? Do you see applications I'm missing? What features would make this more useful for your specific workflows?

I'd really appreciate your thoughts on whether this approach fits data science needs and how I might better position this for data-oriented Python developers.

1k9wng3,Several unavoidable for loops are slowing this PySpark code. Is it possible to improve it?,"Hi. I have a Databricks PySpark notebook that takes 20 minutes to run as opposed to one minute in on-prem Linux + Pandas. How can I speed it up?

It's not a volume issue. The input is around 30k rows. Output is the same because there's no filtering or aggregation; just creating new fields. No collect, count, or display statements (which would slow it down). 

The main thing is a bunch of mappings I need to apply, but it depends on existing fields and there are various models I need to run. So the mappings are different depending on variable and model. That's where the for loops come in. 

Now I'm ***not*** iterating over the dataframe itself; just over 15 fields (different variables) and 4 different mappings. Then do that 10 times (once per model).

The worker is m5d 2x large and drivers are r4 2x large, min/max workers are 4/20. This should be fine.

Background:
	Bachelor’s degree in Data Analytics

	3 years of experience as a Data Analyst (heavy SQL, light Python)

	Daily practice improving my SQL (window functions, CTEs, optimization, etc)

	Building a portfolio on GitHub that includes real-world SQL problems and code

	Actively working on Python fundamentals and plan to move into ETL building soon

Goals before applying:
Build 3 to 5 end-to-end projects involving data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and loading

Learn basic Airflow, dbt, and cloud services (likely AWS S3 and Lambda first)

Post everything to GitHub with strong documentation and clear READMEs

Questions:
1. Based on this track, how close am I to being competitive for an entry-level or junior data engineering role? 
2. Are there any major gaps I am not seeing?

1ka61fg,"How to handle modeling source system data based on date ""ranges""","Hello,

We have a source system that is only able to export data using a ""start"" and ""end"" date range. So for example, each day, we get a ""current month"" export for the data falling between the start of the month and the current day. We also get a ""prior month"" report each day of the data from the full prior month. Finally, we also may get a ""year to date"" file with all of the data from the start of the year to current date.

Nothing in the data export itself gives us an ""as of date"" for the record (the source system uses proprietary information to give us the data that ""falls"" within that range). All we have is the date range for the individual export to go off of.

I'm struggling to figure out how to model this data. Do I simply use three different ""fact"" models? One each for ""daily"" (sourced from the current month file), ""monthly"" (sourced from the prior month file), and ""yearly"" (sourced from the year to date file)? If I do that, how do I handle the different grains for the SCD Type 2 DIM table of the data? What should the VALID\_FROM/VALID\_TO columns be sourced from in this case? The daily makes sense (I would source VALID\_FROM/VALID\_TO from the ""end"" date of the data extract that keeps bumping out each day), but I don't know how that fits into the monthly or yearly data.

1ka3a7b,Doubt about the coexistence of different partitioning methods,"Recently i've been reading ""Designing Data Intensive Applications"" and I came across a concept that made me a little confuse.

In the section that discusses the diferent partition methods (Key Range, hash, etc) we are introduced to the concept of Secondary Indexes, in which a new mapping is created to help in the search for occurences of a particular value. The book gives two examples of data partitioning methods in this scenario:

1. Partitioning Secondary Indexes By Document - The data in the distributed system is allocated to specific partition based on the key range defined to that partition (e.g.: partition 0 goes from 1-5000). 
2. Paritioning Secodary Indexes By Term - The data in the distributed system is allocated to a specific partition base on the value of a term (e.g: all documents with **term:valueX** go to partition N).

In both of the above methods a secondary index for a specific term is configured and for each value of this term a mapping like **term:value -> \[documentX1\_position, documentX2\_position\]** is created. 

My question is how does the primary index and secondary index coexist? The book states that Key Range and Hash partition in the primary index can be employed alongside with the methods mentioned above for the secondary index, but it's not making sense in my head.

For instance, if a Hash partition is employed for the data system documents that have a hash that belongs in partition N hash range will be stored there, but what if partition N has a partitioning term (e.g: **color = red**) based method for a secondary index and the document doesn't belong there (e.g.: document has **color = blue**)? Wouldn't the hash based partition mess up the idead behind partitioning based on term value?

I also thought about the possibility of the document hash being assigned based on the partition term value (e.g.: document\_hash = hash(document\[""color""\])), but then (if I'm not mistaken) we wouldn't have the advantages of uniform distribution of data between partitions that hash based partitioning brings to the table, because all of the hashes in the term partition would be the same (same values).

Maybe I didn't understood it properly, but it's not making sense in my head.",2,6,dagovengo,2025-04-28 18:48:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ka3a7b/doubt_about_the_coexistence_of_different/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-28 18:48:38,18,Monday,368.0,2230,49.86,17,579,14.0,0,0
1k9xbqo,Handling really inefficient partitioning,"I have an application that does some simple pre-processing to batch time series data and feeds it to another system. This downstream system requires data to be split into daily files for consumption. The way we do that is with Hive partitioning while processing and writing the data.

The problem is data processing tools cannot deal with this stupid partitioning system, failing with OOM; sometimes we have 3 years of daily data, which incurs in over a thousand partitions.

Our current data processing tool is Polars (using LazyFrames) and we were studying migrating to DuckDB. Unfortunately, none of these can handle the larger data we have with a reasonable amount of RAM. They can do the processing and write to disk without partitioning, but we get OOM when we try to partition by day.

I'm having a hard time designing for ETL and would like your opinion on the best way to extract this information from my business. 

I have 27 databases (PostgreSQL) that have the same modeling (Column, attributes, etc.). For a while I used Python+PsycoPg2 to extract information in a unified way from customers, vehicles and others. All this I've done at report level, no ETL jobs so far. 

Now, I want to start a Datawarehouse modeling process and unifying all these databases is my priority. I'm thinking of using Airflow to manage all the Postgresql connections and using Python to perform the transformations (SCD dimension and new columns).

For instance, I am able to develop python script that calls an API for data, put into dataframe and ingest into postgresql, orchestras the entire process using dagster. But anything above that is beyond me. I don’t quite know how the wrap the entire process in docker, run it on GCP server etc. I am not even sure if the process is correct in the first place

I’m the founder of [**Notellect.ai**](http://Notellect.ai) (yes, this is self-promotion, posted under the “once-a-month” rule and with the Brand Affiliate tag). After \~2 months of hacking I’ve opened a very small beta and would love blunt, no-fluff feedback from practitioners here.

**What it is:** An “agentic” vibe coding platform that sits between your data and Python:

1. **Data source → LLM → Python → Result**
2. Current sources: CSV/XLSX (adding DBs & warehouses next).
3. You ask a question; the LLM reasons over the files, writes Python, and drops it into an integrated cloud IDE.  (Currently it uses Pyodide with numpy and pandas and more lib supports on the way)
4. You can inspect / tweak the code, run it instantly, and the output is stored in a note for later reuse.

**Why I think it matters**

* Cursor/Windsurf-style “vibe coding” is amazing, but data work needs transparency and repeatability.
* Most tools either hide the code or make you copy-paste between notebooks; I’m trying to keep everything in one place and 100 % visible.

**Looking for feedback on**

* Biggest missing features?
* Deal-breakers for trust/production use?
* Must-have data sources you’d want first?

1kb974e,Spark is the new Hadoop,"In this opinionated article I am going to explain why I believe we have reached peak Spark usage and why it is only downhill from here.

# Before Spark

Some will remember that 12 years ago [Pig](https://pig.apache.org), [Hive](https://hive.apache.org), [Sqoop](https://sqoop.apache.org), [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org) and MapReduce were all the rage. Many of us were under the spell of [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org) during those times.

# Enter Spark

The brilliant [Matei Zaharia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateizaharia/) started working on Spark sometimes before 2010 already, but adoption really only began after 2013.  
The lazy evaluation and memory leveraging as well as other [innovative features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0Tisli7zn4&t=97s) were a huge leap forward and I was dying to try this new promising technology.  
My then CTO was visionary enough to understand the potential and for years since, I, along with many others, ripped the benefits of an only improving Spark.

# The Loosers

How many of you recall companies like [Hortonworks](https://hortonworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Webinar.HDP2_.20131112.pdf) and [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/about.html)? Hortonworks and Cloudera merged after both becoming public, only to be taken private a few years later. Cloudera still exists, but not much more than that.

Those companies were yesterday’s [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com) and they bet big on the Hadoop ecosystem and not so much on Spark.

# Hunting decisions

In creating Spark, Matei did what any pragmatist would have done, he piggybacked on the existing Hadoop ecosystem. This allowed Spark not to be built from scratch in isolation, but integrate nicely in the Hadoop ecosystem and supporting tools.

There is just one problem with the Hadoop ecosystem…it’s exclusively **JVM based**. This decision has fed and made rich thousands of consultants and engineers that have fought with the [GC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) and inconsistent memory issues for years…and still does. The JVM is a solid choice, safe choice, but despite more than 10 years passing and Databricks having the plethora of resources it has, some of Spark's core issues with managing memory and performance just can't be fixed.

# The writing is on the wall

Change is coming, and few are noticing it ([some do](https://nolanlawson.com/2024/10/20/why-im-skeptical-of-rewriting-javascript-tools-in-faster-languages/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). This change is happening in all sorts of supporting tools and frameworks.

What do [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), [Deno](https://deno.com), [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) and the Linux kernel all have in common that no one cares about...for now? They all have a Rust backend or have an increasingly large Rust footprint. These handful of examples are just the tip of the iceberg.

Rust is the most prominent example and the forerunner of a set of languages that offer performance, a completely different memory model and some form of usability that is hard to find in market leaders such as C and C++. There is also Zig which similar to Rust, and a bunch of other languages that can be found in TIOBE's top 100.

The examples I gave above are all of tools for which the primary target are not Rust engineers but Python or JavaScipt. Rust and other languages that allow easy interoperability are increasingly being used as an efficient reliable backend for frameworks targeted at completely different audiences.

There's going to be less of ""by Python developers for Python developers"" looking forward.

# Nothing is forever

Spark is here to stay for many years still, hey, Hive is still being used and maintained, but I belive that peak adoption has been reached, there's nowhere to go from here than downhill. Users don't have much to expect in terms of performance and usability looking forward.

On the other hand, frameworks like [Daft](https://www.getdaft.io) offer a completely different experience working with data, no strange JVM error messages, no waiting for things to boot, just bliss. Maybe it's not Daft that is going to be the next best thing, but it's inevitable that Spark will be overthroned.

# Adapt

Databricks better be ahead of the curve on this one.  
Instead of using scaremongering marketing gimmicks like labelling the use of engines other than Spark as *Allow External Data Access*, it better ride with the wave.",219,88,rocketinter,2025-04-30 05:45:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kb974e/spark_is_the_new_hadoop/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-30 05:45:51,5,Wednesday,644.0,4514,55.34,40,1021,11.6,1,0
1kbbgjb,Why are more people not excited by Polars?,"I’ve benchmarked it. For use cases in my specific industry it’s something like x5, x7 more efficient in computation. It looks like it’s pretty revolutionary in terms of cost savings. It’s faster and cheaper.

The problem is PySpark is like using a missile to kill a worm. In what I’ve seen, it’s totally overpowered for what’s actually needed. It starts spinning up clusters and workers and all the tasks. 

I’m not saying it’s not useful. It’s needed and crucial for huge workloads but most of the time huge workloads are not actually what’s needed.

Spark is perfect with big datasets and when huge data lake where complex computation is needed. It’s a marvel and will never fully disappear for that.

Also Polars syntax and API is very nice to use. It’s written to use only one node. 

By comparison Pandas syntax is not as nice (my opinion). 

And it’s computation is objectively less efficient.  It’s simply worse than Polars in nearly every metric in efficiency terms.

I cant publish the stats because it’s in my company enterprise solution but search on open Github other people are catching on and publishing metrics.

Polars uses Lazy execution, a Rust based computation (Polars is a Dataframe library for Rust). Plus Apache Arrow data format.

It’s pretty clear it occupies that middle ground where Spark is still needed for 10GB/ terabyte / 10-15 million row+ datasets. 

Pandas is useful for small scripts (Excel, Csv) or hobby projects but Polars can do everything Pandas can do and faster and more efficiently.

Spake is always there for the those use cases where you need high performance but don’t need to call in artillery. 

Its syntax means if you know Spark is pretty seamless to learn.

I predict as well there’s going to be massive porting to Polars for ancestor input datasets.

You can use Polars for the smaller inputs that get used further on and keep Spark for the heavy workloads. The problem is converting to different data frames object types and data formats is tricky. Polars is very new.

Many legacy stuff in Pandas over 500k rows where costs is an increasing factor or cloud expensive stuff is also going to see it being used.

1kbctlt,Reflecting On A Year's Worth of Data Engineer Work,"Hey All,

I've had an incredible year and I feel extremely lucky to be in the position I'm in. I'm a relatively new DE, but I've covered so much ground even in one year.

I'm not perfect, but I can feel my growth. Every day I am learning something new and I'm having such joy improving on my craft, my passion, and just loving my experience each day building pipelines, debugging errors, and improving upon existing infrastructure.

As I look back I wanted to share some gems or bits of valuable knowledge I've picked up along the way:

* Showing up in person to the office matters. Your communication, attitude, humbleness, kindness, and selflessness goes a long way and gets noticed. Your relationship with your client matters a lot and being able to be in person means you are the go-to engineer when people need help, education, and fixing things when they break. Working from home is great, but there are more opportunities when you show up for your client in person.
* pre-commit hooks are valuable in creating quality commits. Automatically check yourself even before creating a PR. Use hooks to format your code, scan for errors with linters, etc.
* Build pipelines with failure in mind. Always factor in exception handling, error logging, and other tools to gracefully handle when things go wrong.
* DRY - such as a basic principle but easy to forget. Any time you are repeating yourself or writing code that is duplicated, it's time to turn that into a function. And if you need to keep track of state, use OOP.
* Learn as much as you can about CI/CD. The bugs/issues in CI/CD are a different beast, but peeling back the layers it's not so bad. Practice your understanding of how it all works, it's crucial in DE.
* OOP is a valuable tool. But you need to know when to use it, it's not a hammer you use at every problem. I've seen examples of unnecessary OOP where a FP paradigm was better suited. Practice, practice, practice.
* Build pipelines that heal themselves and parametrize them so users can easily re-run them for data recovery. Use watermarks to know when the last time a table was last updated in the data lake and create logic so that the pipeline will know to recover data from a certain point in time.
* Be the documentation king/queen. Use docstrings, type hints, comments, markdown files, CHANGELOG files, README, etc. throughout your code, modules, packages, repo, etc. to make your work as clear, intentional, and easy to read as possible. Make it easy to spread this information using an appropriate knowledge management solution like Confluence.
* Volunteer to make things better without being asked. Update legacy projects/repos with the latest code or package. Build and create the features you need to make DE work easier. For example, auto-tagging commits with the version number to easily go back to the snapshot of a repo with a long history.
* Unit testing is important. Learn pytest framework, its tools, and practice making your code modular to make unit tests easier to create.
* Create and use a DE repo template using cookiecutter to create consistency in repo structures in all DE projects and include common files (yaml, .gitignore, etc.).
* Knowledge of fundamental SQL if valuable in understanding how to manipulate data. I found it made it easier understanding pandas and pyspark frameworks.

1kawfj1,"I am a Data Engineer, but I have difficulty valuing my experience – is this normal?","Hello everyone,

I've been working as a Data Engineer for a while, mainly on GCP: BigQuery, GCS, Cloud Functions, Cloud SQL.
I have set up quite a few batch pipelines to process and expose business data.
I structured the code in Python with object-oriented logic, automated processing via Cloud Scheduler, optimized BigQuery queries, built tables at the right level for business analysis (product, country, etc.), set up quality tests, benchmarks, etc.

I also work regularly with business lines to understand their needs, structure the data, and present the results in Postgres databases or GCS exports.

But despite all that... I don't find my experience very rewarding given that it's a project that lasted 4 years.

I don’t do real-time processing, no AI, no “fancy” stuff.
Even unit testing, I do very little if at all, because everything happens in BigQuery and I've never really seen the point of testing Python scripts that just execute SQL queries that have already been tested manually.

Sometimes I feel like I'm just getting data from point A to point B, cleanly.
And I wonder: is this “just that”, the job? Or have I missed another level?

Do you feel this too?
Are we underestimating this work, even though it is essential?
And above all, how do you find meaning or progress in this kind of context?

What I needed was a flexible data generation that can create data with a dynamic schema and has the ability to send that data to a destination (csv, kafka).We all have used Faker and its a great library but in itself doesn't finish the job. All my*scriptsl* were using Faker but always extended with some additional usecase. This is how I ended up writing [glassgen](https://pypi.org/project/glassgen/). It generates synthetic data, sends it to a sink and is simply configured by a json config. It can also generate duplicates in the data (if you want) and can send at a defined rps (best effort). 

Happy to hear your feedback and hope you find the library useful.

1kbbc09,Advice on upskilling to break into top data engineering roles,"Hi all,  
I am currently working as a data engineer \~3 YOE currently on notice period of 90 days and Iam looking for guidance on how to upskill and prepare myself to land a job at a top tier company (like FAANG, product-based, or top tech startups).

**My current tech stack:**

* **Languages**: Python, SQL, PLSQL
* **Cloud/Tools**: Snowflake, AWS (Glue, Lambda, S3, EC2, SNS, SQS, Step Functions), Airflow
* **Frameworks**: PySpark (beginner to intermediate), Spark SQL, Snowpark, DBT, Flask, Streamlit
* **Others**: Git, CI/CD, DevOps basics, Schema Change, basic ML knowledge

**What I’ve worked on:**

* designed and scaled etl pipelines with AWS Glue and S3 supporting 10M+ daily records
* developed PySpark jobs for large-scale data transformations 
* built near real time and batch pipelines using Glue, Lambda, Snowpipe, Step Functions, etc.
* Created a Streamlit based analytics dashboard on Snowflake
* worked with RBAC, data masking, CDC, performance tuning in Snowflake
* Built a reusable ETL and Audit Balance Control
* experience with CICD pipelines for code promotion and automation

I feel I have a good base but want to know:

* What skills or tools should I focus on next?
* Is my current stack aligned with what top companies expect?
* Should I go deeper into pyspark or explore something like kafka, kubernetes, data modeling
* How important are system design or coding DSA for data engineer interviews?

would really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or learning paths.

Is there realistic demand for beginner-to-intermediate data scientists or Python devs in the freelance market?

What kind of projects should I be aiming for to get started?

What are businesses really looking for when they hire a freelance data scientist?
Is it dashboards, insights, predictive modeling, cleaning data, reporting? I’d love to hear how you match your skills to their expectations.

For those who haven't come across them:

CKAN is this open-source platform for publishing and managing datasets—used a lot in gov/open data circles.

Data Packages are basically a way to bundle your data (like CSVs) with a datapackage.json file that describes the schema, metadata, etc.

They're not flashy, no Spark, no dbt, no “AI-ready” marketing buzz - but they're super practical for sharing structured data and automating ingestion. Especially if you're dealing with datasets or anything that needs to be portable and well-documented.

So my question is: why don't we talk about them more here? Is it just too ""dataset"" focused? Too old-school? Or am I missing something about why they aren't more widely used in modern data workflows?

1kawaj4,Tools for managing large amounts of templated SQL queries,"My company uses DBT in the transform/silver layer of our quasi-medallion architecture. It's a very small DE team (I'm the second guy they hired) with a historic reliance on low-code tooling I'm helping to migrate us off for scalability reasons.

Previously, we moved data into the report layer via the webhook notification generated by our DBT build process. It pinged a workflow in N8n which ran an ungainly web of many dozens of nodes containing copy-pasted and slightly-modified SQL statements executing in parallel whenever the build job finished. I went through these queries and categorized them into general patterns and made Jinja templates for each pattern. I am also in the process of modifying these statements to use materialized views instead, which is presenting other problems outside the scope of this post.

I've been wondering about ways to manage templated SQL. I had an idea for a Python package that worked with a YAML schema that organized the metadata surrounding the various templates, handled input validation, and generated the resulting queries. By metadata I mean parameter values, required parameters, required columns in the source table, including/excluding various other SQL elements (e.g. a where filter added to the base template), etc. Something like this:

1kayb4e,How to manage business logic in plain English?,"Our organization is not very data savvy. 

For years, we have just handled data requests on an ad-hoc basis when business users email the IS team and ask them to query the OLTP database, which is highly normalized. 

In my view this is simply unsustainable. I am hit with so many of these ad-hoc requests that I hardly have time to develop a data warehouse. Frustratingly, the business is really bad at defining requirements, and it is not uncommon for me to produce a report via a 400-line query only for the business to say, “oh, we actually need this, sorry.” 

In my view, we should have robust reports built in something like PowerBi that gives business users the ability to slice and dice data so we don’t have to write a new query every 20 minutes. However, developing such a report would require the business to get on the same page and adequately capture requirements in plain English.

1kbjfrf,Databricks Notebook is failing after If Condition Fail,"There may be some nuance in ADF that I'm missing, but I can't solve this issue. I have an ADF pipeline that has an If Condition. If the If Condition fails I want to get the error details from the Error Details box, you can get those details from the JSON. After getting the details I have a Databricks notebook that should take those details and add them to an error logging table. The Databricks notebook connects to function that acts as a stored proc, unfortunately Databricks doesn't support stored procs. I know they have videos on it, but their own software says it doesn't support stored procs. 

The issue I'm having is the Databricks notebooks fails to execute if the If Condition fails. From what I can tell the parameters aren't being passed through and the expressions used in the Base parameters aren't being executed.

 I figured it should still run on Completion, but the parameters from the If Condition are only being passed when the If Condition succeeds. Originally the If Condition was the last step of the nested pipeline, I'm adding the Databricks notebook to track when the pipeline fails on that step. The If Condition is nested within a ForEach loop. I tried to set the Databricks to run after the ForEach loop but I keep getting a BadRequest error.

1kb974e,Spark is the new Hadoop,"In this opinionated article I am going to explain why I believe we have reached peak Spark usage and why it is only downhill from here.

# Before Spark

Some will remember that 12 years ago [Pig](https://pig.apache.org), [Hive](https://hive.apache.org), [Sqoop](https://sqoop.apache.org), [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org) and MapReduce were all the rage. Many of us were under the spell of [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org) during those times.

# Enter Spark

The brilliant [Matei Zaharia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateizaharia/) started working on Spark sometimes before 2010 already, but adoption really only began after 2013.  
The lazy evaluation and memory leveraging as well as other [innovative features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0Tisli7zn4&t=97s) were a huge leap forward and I was dying to try this new promising technology.  
My then CTO was visionary enough to understand the potential and for years since, I, along with many others, ripped the benefits of an only improving Spark.

# The Loosers

How many of you recall companies like [Hortonworks](https://hortonworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Webinar.HDP2_.20131112.pdf) and [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/about.html)? Hortonworks and Cloudera merged after both becoming public, only to be taken private a few years later. Cloudera still exists, but not much more than that.

Those companies were yesterday’s [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com) and they bet big on the Hadoop ecosystem and not so much on Spark.

# Hunting decisions

In creating Spark, Matei did what any pragmatist would have done, he piggybacked on the existing Hadoop ecosystem. This allowed Spark not to be built from scratch in isolation, but integrate nicely in the Hadoop ecosystem and supporting tools.

There is just one problem with the Hadoop ecosystem…it’s exclusively **JVM based**. This decision has fed and made rich thousands of consultants and engineers that have fought with the [GC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) and inconsistent memory issues for years…and still does. The JVM is a solid choice, safe choice, but despite more than 10 years passing and Databricks having the plethora of resources it has, some of Spark's core issues with managing memory and performance just can't be fixed.

# The writing is on the wall

Change is coming, and few are noticing it ([some do](https://nolanlawson.com/2024/10/20/why-im-skeptical-of-rewriting-javascript-tools-in-faster-languages/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). This change is happening in all sorts of supporting tools and frameworks.

What do [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), [Deno](https://deno.com), [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) and the Linux kernel all have in common that no one cares about...for now? They all have a Rust backend or have an increasingly large Rust footprint. These handful of examples are just the tip of the iceberg.

Rust is the most prominent example and the forerunner of a set of languages that offer performance, a completely different memory model and some form of usability that is hard to find in market leaders such as C and C++. There is also Zig which similar to Rust, and a bunch of other languages that can be found in TIOBE's top 100.

The examples I gave above are all of tools for which the primary target are not Rust engineers but Python or JavaScipt. Rust and other languages that allow easy interoperability are increasingly being used as an efficient reliable backend for frameworks targeted at completely different audiences.

There's going to be less of ""by Python developers for Python developers"" looking forward.

# Nothing is forever

Spark is here to stay for many years still, hey, Hive is still being used and maintained, but I belive that peak adoption has been reached, there's nowhere to go from here than downhill. Users don't have much to expect in terms of performance and usability looking forward.

On the other hand, frameworks like [Daft](https://www.getdaft.io) offer a completely different experience working with data, no strange JVM error messages, no waiting for things to boot, just bliss. Maybe it's not Daft that is going to be the next best thing, but it's inevitable that Spark will be overthroned.

# Adapt

Databricks better be ahead of the curve on this one.  
Instead of using scaremongering marketing gimmicks like labelling the use of engines other than Spark as *Allow External Data Access*, it better ride with the wave.",246,98,rocketinter,2025-04-30 05:45:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kb974e/spark_is_the_new_hadoop/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-30 05:45:51,5,Wednesday,644.0,4514,55.34,40,1021,11.6,1,0
1kbbgjb,Why are more people not excited by Polars?,"I’ve benchmarked it. For use cases in my specific industry it’s something like x5, x7 more efficient in computation. It looks like it’s pretty revolutionary in terms of cost savings. It’s faster and cheaper.

The problem is PySpark is like using a missile to kill a worm. In what I’ve seen, it’s totally overpowered for what’s actually needed. It starts spinning up clusters and workers and all the tasks. 

I’m not saying it’s not useful. It’s needed and crucial for huge workloads but most of the time huge workloads are not actually what’s needed.

Spark is perfect with big datasets and when huge data lake where complex computation is needed. It’s a marvel and will never fully disappear for that.

Also Polars syntax and API is very nice to use. It’s written to use only one node. 

By comparison Pandas syntax is not as nice (my opinion). 

And it’s computation is objectively less efficient.  It’s simply worse than Polars in nearly every metric in efficiency terms.

I cant publish the stats because it’s in my company enterprise solution but search on open Github other people are catching on and publishing metrics.

Polars uses Lazy execution, a Rust based computation (Polars is a Dataframe library for Rust). Plus Apache Arrow data format.

It’s pretty clear it occupies that middle ground where Spark is still needed for 10GB/ terabyte / 10-15 million row+ datasets. 

Pandas is useful for small scripts (Excel, Csv) or hobby projects but Polars can do everything Pandas can do and faster and more efficiently.

Spake is always there for the those use cases where you need high performance but don’t need to call in artillery. 

Its syntax means if you know Spark is pretty seamless to learn.

I predict as well there’s going to be massive porting to Polars for ancestor input datasets.

You can use Polars for the smaller inputs that get used further on and keep Spark for the heavy workloads. The problem is converting to different data frames object types and data formats is tricky. Polars is very new.

Many legacy stuff in Pandas over 500k rows where costs is an increasing factor or cloud expensive stuff is also going to see it being used.

1kbctlt,Reflecting On A Year's Worth of Data Engineer Work,"Hey All,

I've had an incredible year and I feel extremely lucky to be in the position I'm in. I'm a relatively new DE, but I've covered so much ground even in one year.

I'm not perfect, but I can feel my growth. Every day I am learning something new and I'm having such joy improving on my craft, my passion, and just loving my experience each day building pipelines, debugging errors, and improving upon existing infrastructure.

As I look back I wanted to share some gems or bits of valuable knowledge I've picked up along the way:

* Showing up in person to the office matters. Your communication, attitude, humbleness, kindness, and selflessness goes a long way and gets noticed. Your relationship with your client matters a lot and being able to be in person means you are the go-to engineer when people need help, education, and fixing things when they break. Working from home is great, but there are more opportunities when you show up for your client in person.
* pre-commit hooks are valuable in creating quality commits. Automatically check yourself even before creating a PR. Use hooks to format your code, scan for errors with linters, etc.
* Build pipelines with failure in mind. Always factor in exception handling, error logging, and other tools to gracefully handle when things go wrong.
* DRY - such as a basic principle but easy to forget. Any time you are repeating yourself or writing code that is duplicated, it's time to turn that into a function. And if you need to keep track of state, use OOP.
* Learn as much as you can about CI/CD. The bugs/issues in CI/CD are a different beast, but peeling back the layers it's not so bad. Practice your understanding of how it all works, it's crucial in DE.
* OOP is a valuable tool. But you need to know when to use it, it's not a hammer you use at every problem. I've seen examples of unnecessary OOP where a FP paradigm was better suited. Practice, practice, practice.
* Build pipelines that heal themselves and parametrize them so users can easily re-run them for data recovery. Use watermarks to know when the last time a table was last updated in the data lake and create logic so that the pipeline will know to recover data from a certain point in time.
* Be the documentation king/queen. Use docstrings, type hints, comments, markdown files, CHANGELOG files, README, etc. throughout your code, modules, packages, repo, etc. to make your work as clear, intentional, and easy to read as possible. Make it easy to spread this information using an appropriate knowledge management solution like Confluence.
* Volunteer to make things better without being asked. Update legacy projects/repos with the latest code or package. Build and create the features you need to make DE work easier. For example, auto-tagging commits with the version number to easily go back to the snapshot of a repo with a long history.
* Unit testing is important. Learn pytest framework, its tools, and practice making your code modular to make unit tests easier to create.
* Create and use a DE repo template using cookiecutter to create consistency in repo structures in all DE projects and include common files (yaml, .gitignore, etc.).
* Knowledge of fundamental SQL if valuable in understanding how to manipulate data. I found it made it easier understanding pandas and pyspark frameworks.

1kbt10i,An open-source framework to build analytical backends,"Hey all! 

Over the years, I’ve worked at companies as small as a team of 10 and at organizations with thousands of data engineers, and I’ve seen wildly different philosophies around analytical data.

Some organizations go with the ""build it and they will come"" data lake approach, broadly ingesting data without initial structure, quality checks, or governance, and later deriving value via a medallion architecture.

Others embed governed analytical data directly into their user-facing or internal operations apps. These companies tend to treat their data like core backend services managed with a focus on getting schemas, data quality rules, and governance right from the start. Similar to how transactional data is managed in a classic web app.

I’ve found that most data engineering frameworks today are designed for the former state, Airflow, Spark, and DBT really shine when there’s a lack of clarity around how you plan on leveraging your data. 

I’ve spent the past year building an open-source framework around a data stack that's built for the latter case (clickhouse, redpanda, duckdb, etc)—when companies/teams know what they want to do with their data and need to build analytical backends that power user-facing or operational analytics quickly.

The framework has the following core principles behind it:

1. Derive as much of the infrastructure as possible from the business logic to minimize the amount of boilerplate
2. Enable a local developer experience so that I could build my analytical backends right alongside my Frontend (in my office, in the desert, or on plane)
3. Leverage data validation standards— like types and validation libraries such as pydantic or typia—to enforce data quality controls and make testing easy
4. Build in support for the best possible analytical infra while keeping things extensible to incrementally support legacy and emerging analytical stacks
5. Support the same languages we use to build transactional apps. I started with Python and TypeScript but I plan to expand to others

The framework is still in beta and it’s now used by teams at big and small companies to build analytical backends. I’d love some feedback from this community

You can take it for a spin by starting from a boilerplate starter project:[ https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/quickstart](https://docs.fiveonefour.com/moose/quickstart)

For those who haven't come across them:

CKAN is this open-source platform for publishing and managing datasets—used a lot in gov/open data circles.

Data Packages are basically a way to bundle your data (like CSVs) with a datapackage.json file that describes the schema, metadata, etc.

They're not flashy, no Spark, no dbt, no “AI-ready” marketing buzz - but they're super practical for sharing structured data and automating ingestion. Especially if you're dealing with datasets or anything that needs to be portable and well-documented.

So my question is: why don't we talk about them more here? Is it just too ""dataset"" focused? Too old-school? Or am I missing something about why they aren't more widely used in modern data workflows?

I'm looking for a tool to help manage collections of these objects, as an item may be part of one, none, or multiple datasets. An image may have any number of associated annotations from human and models. 

I've been reading up on a few different OSS feature store and data management solutions, like Feast, Hopsworks, FeatureForm, DVC, LakeFS, but it's not clear whether these tools do what I'm asking, which is to make and manage collections from the individual datum (without duplicating the underlying data), as well as multiple instances of associated labels. 

Currently I'm tempted to roll out a relational DB to keep track of the image S3 keys, image metadata, collections/datasets, and labels... but surely there's a solution for this kind of thing out there already. Is it so basic it's not advertised and I missed it somehow, or is this not a typical use-case for other projects?

I understand most businesses will always just go for the out of the box, click and forget approach, or the option from the big providers like Azure, Aws, Gcp, etc.

However, I'm more interested in finding a company building it open source or at least managed outside of a big platform.

I've done this a couple of ways over the years:

\- Download directly (slow if it's really big)

\- Access via some Python interface (slow and annoying)

\- S3 Select (RIP)

\- Creating an Athena table around the data (worst experience ever).

If the If Condition fails I want to get the error details from the Error Details box, you can get those details from the JSON. After getting the details I have a Databricks notebook that should take those details and add them to an error logging table. The Databricks notebook connects to function that acts as a stored proc, unfortunately Databricks doesn't support stored procs. I know they have videos on it, but their own software says it doesn't support stored procs. 

The issue I'm having is the Databricks notebooks fails to execute if the If Condition fails. From what I can tell the parameters aren't being passed through and the expressions used in the Base parameters aren't being executed.

 I figured it should still run on Completion, but the parameters from the If Condition are only being passed when the If Condition succeeds. Originally the If Condition was the last step of the nested pipeline, I'm adding the Databricks notebook to track when the pipeline fails on that step. The If Condition is nested within a ForEach loop. I tried to set the Databricks to run after the ForEach loop but I keep getting a BadRequest error.

🔹 Optimize resource allocation  
🔹 Speed up reporting processes for accreditation and funding  
🔹 Improve operational decision-making across departments

1kcd6ul,"StatQL – live, approximate SQL for huge datasets and many tenants","I built StatQL after spending too many hours waiting for scripts to crawl hundreds of tenant databases in my last job (we had a db-per-tenant setup).

With StatQL you write one SQL query, hit Enter, and see a first estimate in seconds—even if the data lives in dozens of Postgres DBs, a giant Redis keyspace, or a filesystem full of logs.

What makes it tick:

* A sampling loop keeps a fixed-size reservoir (say 1 M rows/keys/files) that’s refreshed continuously and evenly.
* An aggregation loop reruns your SQL on that reservoir, streaming back value ± 95 % error bars.
* As more data gets scanned by the first loop, the reservoir becomes more representative of entire population.
* Wildcards like pg.?.?.?.orders or fs.?.entries let you fan a single query across clusters, schemas, or directory trees.

1kcbp7q,Are there any good data platforms that have good built in project documentation?,"With all of the bells and whistles that these modern data platforms have I'd expect them all to have basic IDE style pop-up documentation tooltips when querying from a table or joining on another. I'm only really familiar with a handful of these platforms but even just selecting a column I normally have to go and dig up it's data type from some other interface, let alone getting any of the engineers' documentation on it.

Snowflake for instance allows us to create `comments` pinned to tables, views, schemas , columns. The lot basically. Why are these comments so hidden to our users whilst they're actually writing the queries that make use of these tables, columns, etc?

Our team goes to a decent amount of effort to build useful and readable documentation around each table but is it any use if the end users have to pull up the docs in a separate tab before they understand that they're using the wrong column for their joins?

This feels like something that's not too hard to implement, I know having objects tagged with a comment or description is already a nice to have in the data world but surely we can do better? Please tell me that I've just been unlucky and most solutions do this cleanly out of the box.

1kc6nen,Shopify GraphQL Data Ingestion,"Hi everyone 

Full disclosure. I’m a data engineer for 3 years and now I’m facing a challenge.
Most of my prior needs were develop my pipeline using DBT and Fivetran as the data ingestion tool. But the company I’m working no longer approves the use of both tools and now I need to implement these two layers (ingestion and transformation) using GCP environment 
The basic architecture of the application I have approved, it will be :
- cloud Run generating csv. One per table/day
- cloud composer calling sql files to run the transformations

The difficult part (for me) is the Python development.
This is my first actual python development, so I’m pretty new to this part, even having some theoretical knowledge of python concepts

So far I was able to create a python app that
- connect with Shopify session
- runs a graphQL query 
- generate a csv file
- upload to a gcs bucket

My current challenge is to implement a date filter into the graphQL query and creates one file for each day.

Has anyone implemented something like this ?

Hi everyone,

I’m based in the U.S. and have around 8 years of experience as a data engineer, primarily working with legacy ETL tools like Ab Initio and Informatica. I was laid off last year, and since then, I’ve been struggling to find roles that still value those tools.

Realizing the market has moved on, I took time to upskill myself – I’ve been learning Python, Apache Spark, and have also brushed up on advanced SQL. I’ve completed several online courses and done some hands-on practice, but when it comes to actual job interviews (especially those first calls with hiring managers), I’m not making it through.

This has really shaken my confidence. I’m beginning to worry: did I wait too long to make the shift? Is my career in data engineering over?

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has advice on how to bridge this gap, especially when transitioning from legacy tech to modern stacks, I’d really appreciate your thoughts.

Where it falls short is if we need to do any sort of analytical work. As soon as the queries get complex, the time to complete skyrockets. 

I started using duckDB and that helped tremendously. The only issue was the scaffolding every time just so I could do some querying was tedious and the overall experience is pretty terrible when you compare writing SQL in a notebook or script vs an editor.

I liked the duckDB UI but the non-persistent nature causes a lot of headache. This led me to build [soarSQL](https://soarsql.com/) which is a duckDB powered SQL editor. 

soarSQL has quickly become my default SQL editor at work because it makes working with OLTP databases a breeze. On top of this, I get save a some money each month because I the bulk of the processing happens on my machine locally!

For some data sources that we deal with, afaik there isn't any product available that would even do what's needed, e.g. send a GET request to endpoint E with payload P if conditions C1 or C2 or ... or Cn are met, schedule that with cronjob T, and then write the response to the DW. Which I imagine is a very normal situation.

I keep seeing huge deals in the ETL space (fivetran just acquired census btw), and I wonder who's making the procurement decisions that culminate in the tens of thousands of six or seven digit monthly ETL bills that justify these valuations.

1kd34is,Data infrastructure for self-driving labs,"Hello folks, I recently joined a research center with a mission to manage data generated from our many labs. This is my first time building data infrastructure, I'm eager to learn from you in the industry.

We deal with a variety of data. Time-series from sensor data log, graph data from knowledge graph, and vector data from literature embedding. We also have relational data coming from characterization. Right now, each lab manages their own data, they are all saved as Excel for csv files in disperse places.

From initial discussion, we think that we should do the following:

A. Find databases to house the lab operational data.

B. Implement a data lake to centralize all the data from different labs

C. Turn all relational data to documents (JSON), as schema might evolve and we don't really do heave analytics or reporting, AI/ML modelling is more of the focus.

If you have any comments on the above points, they will be much appreciated.

I also have a question in mind:

1. For databases, is it better to find specific database for each type of data (neo4j for graph, Chroma for vector...etc), or we would be better of with a general purpose database (e.g. Cassandra) that houses all types of data to simplify managing processes but to lose specific computing capacity for each data type(for example, Cassandra can't do graph traversal)?
2. Cloud infrastructure seems to be the trend, but we have our own data center so we need to leverage it. Is it possible to use the managed solution from Cloud provides (Azure, AWS, we don't have a preference yet) and still work with our own storage and compute on-prem?

1kd422z,Replace a web app with dataiku - advice?,"Hello everyone,

I work as a Data Engineer in a team where we have set up a fairly standard but robust processing chain:
	• We have “raw” tables in BigQuery
	• We make transformations to move from the fine mesh (transaction) to the aggregate mesh.
	• Then we export a copy of this data into PostgreSQL
	• The backend relies on these tables to power a web application allowing businesses to make dynamic multi-mesh aggregations

And there… we are being told that we are going to replace this web application with Dataiku.
The idea is to keep the processing in BigQuery, but for business users to do their exploration directly via Dataiku instead of going through the app.

I am divided:
	• I understand that Dataiku can give more autonomy to professions
	• But I find that it is not designed for dynamic or multi-mesh visualization
	• And that seems a little rigid to me compared to a web front which offered more control, more logic, and a real UX

Have any of you experienced a similar situation?

 - getting myself on the short list for layoffs

1ktkqj6,Modular Data Pipeline (Microservices + Delta Lake) for Live ETAs – Architecture Review of La Poste’s Case,"In a recent blog, the team at La Poste (France’s postal service) shared how they redesigned their real-time package tracking pipeline from a monolithic app into a modular microservice architecture. The goal was to provide more accurate ETA predictions for deliveries while making the system easier to scale and monitor in production. They describe splitting the pipeline into multiple decoupled stages (using Pathway – an open-source streaming ETL engine) connected via Delta Lake storage and Kafka. This revamped design not only improved performance and reliability, but also significantly cut costs (the blog cites a 50% reduction in total cost of ownership for the IoT data platform and a projected 16% drop in fleet capital expenditures, which is huge). Below I’ll outline the architecture, key decisions, and trade-offs from the blog in an engineering-focused way.

From Monolith to Microservices: Originally, a single streaming pipeline handled everything: data cleansing, ETA calculation, and maybe some basic monitoring. That monolith worked for a prototype, but it became hard to extend – for instance, adding continuous evaluation of prediction accuracy or integrating new models would make the one pipeline much more complex and fragile. The team decided to decouple the concerns into separate pipelines (microservices) that communicate through shared data layers. This is analogous to breaking a big application into microservices – here each Pathway pipeline is a lightweight service focused on one part of the workflow.

They ended up with four main pipeline components:

1. Data Acquisition & Cleaning: Ingest raw telemetry from delivery vehicles and clean it. IoT devices on trucks emit location updates (latitude/longitude, speed, timestamp, etc.) to a Kafka topic. This first pipeline reads from Kafka, applies a schema, and filters out bad data (e.g. GPS (0,0) errors, duplicates, out-of-order events). The cleaned, normalized data is then written to a Delta Lake table as the “prepared data” store. Delta Lake was used here to persist the stream in a queryable table format (every incoming event gets appended as a new row). This makes the downstream processing simpler and the intermediate data reusable. (Notably, they chose Delta Lake over something like chaining another Kafka topic for the clean data – a design choice we’ll discuss more below.)

2. ETA Prediction: This stage consumes two things – the cleaned vehicle data (from that Delta table) and incoming ETA requests. ETA request events come as another stream (Kafka topic) containing a delivery request ID, the target destination, the assigned vehicle ID, and a timestamp. The topic is partitioned by vehicle ID so all requests for the same vehicle are ordered (ensuring the sequence of stops is handled correctly). The Pathway pipeline joins each request with the latest state of the corresponding vehicle from the clean data, then computes an estimated arrival time. The blog kept the prediction logic straightforward (e.g., basically using current location to estimate travel time to the destination), since the focus was architecture. The important part is that this service is stateless with respect to historical data – it relies on the up-to-date clean data table as its source of truth for vehicle positions. Once an ETA is computed for a request, the result is written out to two places: a Kafka topic (so that whoever requested the ETA gets the answer in real-time) and another Delta Lake table storing all predictions (for later analysis).

3. Ground Truth Extraction: This pipeline waits for deliveries to actually be completed, so they can record the real arrival times (“ground truth” data for model evaluation). It reads the same prepared data table (vehicle telemetry) and the requests stream/table to know what destinations were expected. The logic here tracks each vehicle’s journey and identifies when a vehicle has reached the delivery location for a request (and has no further pending deliveries for that request). When it detects a completed delivery, it logs the actual time of arrival for that specific order. Each of these actual arrival records is written to a ground-truth Delta Lake table. This component runs asynchronously from the prediction one – an order might be delivered 30 minutes after the prediction was made, but by isolating this in its own service, the system can handle that naturally without slowing down predictions. Essentially, the ground truth job is doing a continuous join between live positions and the list of active delivery requests, looking for matches to signal completion.

4. Evaluation & Monitoring: The final stage joins the predictions with their corresponding ground truths to measure accuracy. It reads from the predictions Delta table and the ground truths table, linking records by request ID (each record pairs a predicted arrival time with the actual arrival time for a delivery). The pipeline then computes error metrics. For example, it can calculate the difference in minutes between predicted and actual delivery time for each order. These per-delivery error records are extremely useful for analytics – the blog mentions calculating overall Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and also segmenting error by how far in advance the prediction was made (predictions made closer to the delivery tend to be more accurate). Rather than hard-coding any specific aggregation in the pipeline, the approach was to output the raw prediction-vs-actual data into a PostgreSQL database (or even just a CSV file), and then use external tools or dashboards for deeper analysis and alerting. By doing so, they keep the streaming pipeline focused and let data analysts iterate on metrics in a familiar environment. (One cool extension: because everything is modular, they can add an alerting microservice that monitors this error data stream in real-time – e.g. trigger a Slack alert if error spikes – without impacting the other components.)

Key Architectural Decisions:

Decoupling via Delta Lake Tables: A standout decision was to connect these microservice pipelines using Delta Lake as the intermediate store. Instead of passing intermediate data via queues or Kafka topics, each stage writes its output to a durable table that the next stage reads. For example, the clean telemetry is a Delta table that both the Prediction and Ground Truth services read from. This has several benefits in a data engineering context:

Data Reusability & Observability: Because intermediate results are in tables, it’s easy to query or snapshot them at any time. If predictions look off, engineers can examine the cleaned data table to trace back anomalies. In a pure streaming hand-off (e.g. Kafka topic chaining), debugging would be harder – you’d have to attach consumers or replay logs to inspect events. Here, Delta gives a persistent history you can query with Spark/Pandas, etc.

Multiple Consumers: Many pipelines can read the same prepared dataset in parallel. The La Poste use case leveraged this to have two different processes (prediction and ground truth) independently consuming the prepared\_data table. Kafka could also multicast to multiple consumers, but those consumers would each need to handle data cleaning or maintaining state. With the Delta approach, the heavy lifting (cleaning) is done once and all consumers get a consistent view of the results.

Failure Recovery: If one pipeline crashes or needs to be redeployed, the downstream pipelines don’t lose data – the intermediate state is stored in Delta. They can simply pick up from the last processed record by reading the table. There’s less worry about Kafka retention or exactly-once delivery mechanics between services, since the data lake serves as a reliable buffer and single source of truth.

Of course, there are trade-offs. Writing to a data lake introduces some latency (micro-batch writes of files) compared to an in-memory event stream. It also costs storage – effectively duplicating data that in a pure streaming design might be transient. The blog specifically calls out the issue of many small files: frequent Delta commits (especially for high-volume streams) create lots of tiny parquet files and transaction log entries, which can degrade read performance over time. The team mitigated this by partitioning the Delta tables (e.g. by date) and periodically compacting small files. Partitioning by a day or similar key means new data accumulates in a separate folder each day, which keeps the number of files per partition manageable and makes it easier to run vacuum/compaction on older partitions. With these maintenance steps (partition + compact + clean old metadata), they report that the Delta-based approach remains efficient even for continuous, long-running pipelines. It’s a case of trading some complexity in storage management for a lot of flexibility in pipeline design.

Schema Management & Versioning: With data passing through tables, keeping schemas in sync became an important consideration. If the schema of the cleaned data table changes (say they add a new column from the IoT feed), then the downstream Pathway jobs reading that table must be updated to expect that schema. The blog notes this as an increased maintenance overhead compared to a monolith. They likely addressed it by versioning their data schemas and coordinating deployments – e.g. update the writing pipeline to add new columns in parallel with updating readers, or use schema evolution features of Delta Lake. On the plus side, using Delta Lake made some aspects of schema handling easier: Pathway automatically stores each table’s schema in the Delta log, so when a job reads the table it can fetch the schema and apply it without manual definitions. This reduces code duplication and errors. Still, any intentional schema changes require careful planning across multiple services. This is just the nature of microservices – you gain modularity at the cost of more coordination.

Independent Scaling & Fault Isolation: A big reason for the microservice approach was scalability and reliability in production. Each pipeline can be scaled horizontally on its own. For example, if ETA requests volume spikes, they could scale out just the Prediction service (Pathway supports parallel processing within a job as well, but logically separating it is an extra layer of scalability). Meanwhile, the data cleaning service might be CPU-bound and need its own scaling considerations, separate from the evaluation service which might be lighter. In a monolithic pipeline, you’d have to scale the whole thing as one unit, even if only one part is the bottleneck. By splitting them, only the hot spots get more resources. Likewise, if the evaluation pipeline fails due to, say, a bug or out-of-memory error, it doesn’t bring down the ingestion or prediction pipelines – they keep running and data accumulates in the tables. The ops team can fix and redeploy the evaluation job and catch up on the stored data. This isolation is crucial for a production system where you want to minimize downtime and avoid one component’s failure cascading into an outage of the whole feature.

Pipeline Extensibility: The modular design also opened up new capabilities with minimal effort. The case study highlights a few:

They can easily plug in an anomaly detection/alerting service that reads the continuous error metrics (from the evaluation stage) and sends notifications if something goes wrong (e.g., if predictions suddenly become very inaccurate, indicating a possible model issue or data drift).

They can do offline model retraining or improvement by leveraging the historical data collected. Since they’re storing all cleaned inputs and outcomes, they have a high-quality dataset to train next-generation models. The blog mentions using the accumulated Delta tables of inputs and ground truths to experiment with improved prediction algorithms offline.

They can perform A/B testing of prediction strategies by running two prediction pipelines in parallel. For example, run the current model on half the vehicles and a new model on a subset of vehicles (perhaps by partitioning the Kafka requests by transport\_unit\_id hash). Because the infrastructure supports multiple pipelines reading the same input and writing results, this is straightforward – you just add another Pathway service, maybe writing its predictions to a different topic/table, and compare the evaluation metrics in the end. In a monolithic system, A/B testing could be really cumbersome or require building that logic into the single pipeline.

  
Operational Insights: On the operations side, the team did have to invest in coordinated deployments and monitoring for multiple services. There are four Pathway processes to deploy (plus Kafka, plus maybe the Delta Lake storage on S3 or HDFS, and the Postgres DB for results). Automated deploy pipelines and containerization likely help here (the blog doesn’t go deep into it, but it’s implied that there’s added complexity). Monitoring needs to cover each component’s health as well as end-to-end latency. The payoff is that each component is simpler by itself and can be updated or rolled back independently. For instance, deploying a new model in the Prediction service doesn’t require touching the ingestion or evaluation code at all – reducing risk. The scaling benefits were already mentioned: Pathway allows configuring parallelism for each pipeline, and because of the microservice separation, they only scale the parts that need it. This kind of targeted scaling can be more cost-efficient.

The La Poste case is a compelling example of applying software engineering best practices (modularity, fault isolation, clear data contracts) to a streaming data pipeline. It demonstrates how breaking a pipeline into microservices can yield significant improvements in maintainability and extensibility for data engineering workflows. Of course, as the authors caution, this isn’t a silver bullet – one should adopt such complexity only when the benefits (scaling, flexibility, etc.) outweigh the overhead. In their scenario of continuously improving an ETA prediction service, the trade-off made sense and paid off.

I found this architecture interesting, especially the use of Delta Lake as a communication layer between streaming jobs – it’s a hybrid approach that combines real-time processing with durable data lake storage. It raises some great discussion points: e.g., would you have used message queues (Kafka topics) between each stage instead, and how would that compare? How do others handle schema evolution across pipeline stages in production? The post provides a concrete case study to think about these questions. If you want to dive deeper or see code snippets of how Pathway implements these connectors (Kafka read/write, Delta Lake integration, etc.), I recommend checking out the original blog and the Pathway GitHub.

1ktqbov,"Sharing cache between spark executors, possible?","Hi,

  
I'm trying to make parallel API calls using pyspark RDD.  
I have list of tuples like : (TableName, URL, Offset) . I'm making RDD out of it. So the structure looks like something like this :  


|TableName|URL|Offset|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Invoices|[https://api.example.com/invoices](https://api.example.com/invoices)|0|
|Invoices|[https://api.example.com/invoices](https://api.example.com/invoices)|100|
|Invoices|[https://api.example.com/invoices](https://api.example.com/invoices)|200|
|PurchaseOrders|[https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders](https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders)|0|
|PurchaseOrders|[https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders](https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders)|150|
|PurchaseOrders|[https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders](https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders)|300|

 For each RDD, a function is called to extract data from API and returns a dictionary of data.

Later on I want to filter RDD based on table name and create separate dataframes out of it. Each table has a different schema, so I'm avoiding creating a data frame that could include extra irrelevant schemas for my tables

    rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(offset_tuple_list)
    fetch_rdd = rdd.flatMap(lambda tuple:get_data(tuple,extraction_date,token)).cache()
    
    ## filter RDD per table
    invoices_rdd = fetch_rdd.filter(lambda row: row[""table""] == ""Invoices"")
    purchaseOrders_rdd = fetch_rdd.filter(lambda row: row[""table""] == ""PurchaseOrders"")
    
    ## convert it to json for automatic schema inference by read.json
    invoices_json_rdd = invoices_rdd.map(lambda row: json.dumps(row))
    purchaseOrders_json_rdd = purchaseOrders_rdd.map(lambda row: json.dumps(row))
    
    invoices_df = spark.read.json(invoices_json_rdd)
    purchaseOrders_df = spark.read.json(purchaseOrders_json_rdd)

I'm using cache() to avoid multiple API calls and do it only once.  
My problem is that caching won't work for me if **invoices\_df and purchaseOrders\_df**  are running by different executors. If they are run on the same executor then one takes 3 min and the other a few seconds, since it uses the cache(). If not both take 3 min + 3 min = 6min calling API twice.  
  
This behaviour is random, sometimes it runs on separate executors and I can see locality becomes RACK\_LOCAL instead of PROCESS\_LOCAL  


Any idea how I can make all executors use the same cached RDD? ",3,1,AartaXerxes,2025-05-23 18:06:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ktqbov/sharing_cache_between_spark_executors_possible/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-05-23 18:06:20,18,Friday,258.0,2380,18.11,22,500,11.5,1,1
1ktn8tv,Should I switch teams? Manager limiting my growth opportunities,"Background: 

I’m on a support data engineering team and have recently been working on a full stack project that helped me learn new tools and skills that I was really interested in. I really enjoyed the work and felt like I was growing in the right direction. I also expressed my interest in this work with my manager and he said he would forward any similar projects to me as they come. 

The issue: 

However, now my manager seems to have changed his mind and told me that any future full stack opportunities will go to other team members instead of me because “I’ve had enough.” His reasoning is that projects should rotate through the team members one by one before coming back to me. While I understand wanting to give everyone opportunities, this feels like it’s limiting my ability to build expertise and grow in areas where I’m performing well.

I’m also sensing some tension from teammates who seem to think I’m being “greedy” for wanting to continue with this type of work, even though I’m just trying to advance my career like anyone else would.

My question: I’m considering talking to the director of data engineering about potentially switching to a different team that focuses more on core data engineering work rather than support. Is this a reasonable move, or should I try to work things out with my current manager first?

Additional context:
- I’ve been doing well in the full stack/data engineering work and it aligns with my career goals
- This seems to be part of a broader pattern where I feel like growth opportunities are being limited
- The team culture feels like it discourages ambition or self-advocacy

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?

Of course we are just getting started, so one might suggest choosing a barebone DB and some basic tools to launch the app, but anticipating traffic, we want to distill the best knowledge available out there and choose the best stack to build our product from the beginning.

For our chat application, where all typical user behaviors are there - messages, spaces, ""last seen"" or ""active"" statuses, message notifications, read receipts, etc. we need to choose a database to store all our chats. We also want to enable chat searches, and since search will inevitably lead to random chats, we want that perf to be consistently excellent.

We are planning to use Django (with channels) as our backend. What database is recommended to use with Django to persist the messages? I read that Discord used to use Cassandra, but then it started acting up due to garbage collection, so they switched rto Scylla, and they are very happy with trillions of messages on it. Is ScyllDB a good candidate for our purpose to use with Django? Do these two work together well?

I would like to hear suggestions on how to handle this. I have tested Lambda Transformations but I am getting errors since my json is 12x longer than that. I wonder if Kinesis Firehose can handle that without any coding. I researched but it appears not to handle that nested level.

1kupvm8,Next steps for portfolio project?,"Hello everyone! I am an early career SWE (2.5 YoE) trying to land an early or mid-level data engineering role in a tech hub. I have a Python project that pulls dog listings from one of my local animal shelters daily, cleans the data, and then writes to an Azure PostgreSQL database. I also wrote some APIs for the db to pull schema data, active/recently retired listings, etc. I'm at an impasse with what to do next. I am considering three paths:

1. Build a frontend and containerize. Frontend would consist of a Django/Flask interface that shows active dog listings and/or links to a Tableau dashboard that displays data on old listings of dogs who have since left the shelter.

2. Refactor my code with PySpark. Right now I'm storing data in basic Pandas dataframes so that I can clean them and push them to a single Azure PostgreSQL node. It's a fairly small animal shelter, so I'm only handling up to 80-100 records a day, but refactoring would at least prove Spark skills.

3. Scale up and include more shelters (would probably follow #2). Right now, I'm only pulling from a single shelter that only has up to ~100 dogs at a time. I could try to scale up and include listings from all animal shelters within a certain distance from me. Only potential downside is increase in cloud budget if I have to set up multiple servers for cloud computing/db storage.

Which of these paths should I prioritize for?

I just came out from an int. with a software development company for a Data Engineering position.

I received feedback (which surprised me tbh) that said that ""I must have experience with Airflow, Spark, Kafka"" and so on ""because it's what the market is expecting you to know"".

My question is, how do you handle getting experience with these tool when Business doesn't need to? More often than not, companies don't need to deploy an Airflow server for Orchestration or a Kafka one for Streaming because they don't need to do Streaming, or even the Orchestration could be done by using Glue or ADF (for example). I see many post regarding poorly architectured solutions that rely on pyspark when the processing could've been done using pandas, and so on.

So, how do maintain relevant in a Business that apparently needs those tools, when in reality, a large part of companies doesn't need them at all, or even the tech stack is not in favor of using those tools?

1kv520y,Decentralised vs distributed architecture for ETL batches,"Hi,

We are a traditional software engineering team having sole experience in developing web services so far using Java with Spring Boot. We now have a new requirement in our team to engineer data pipelines that comply with standard ETL batch protocol. 

Since our team is well equipped in working with Java and Spring Boot, we want to continue using this tech stack to establish our ETL batches. We do not want to pivot away from our regular tech stack for ETL requirements. We found Spring Batch  helps us to establish ETL compliant batches without introducing new learning friction or $ costs.

Now comes the main pain point that is dividing our team politically. 

Some team members are advocating towards decentralised scripts that are knowledgeable enough to execute independently as a standard web service in tandem with a local cron template to perform their concerned function and operated manually by hand on each of our horizontally scaled infrastructure. Their only argument is that it prevents a single point of failure without caring for the overheads of a batch manager. 

While the other part of the team wants to use the remote partitioning job feature from a mature batch processing framework (Spring Batch for example) to achieve the same functionality as of the decentralized cron driven script but in a distributed fashion over our already horizontally scaled infrastructure to have more control on the operational concerns of the execution. Their argument is deep observability, easier run and restarts, efficient cron synchronisation over different timezones and servers while risking a single point of failure.

We have a single source of truth that contains the infrastructure metadata of all servers where the batch jobs would execute so leveraging it within a batch framework makes more sense IMO to dynamically create remote partitions to execute our ETL process.

I would like to get your views on what would be the best approach to handle the implementation and architectural nature of our ETL use case?

We have a downstream data warehouse already in place for our ETL use case to write data but its managed by a different department so we can't directly integrate into it but have to do it with a non industry standard company wide red tape bureaucratic process but this is a story for another day.",3,7,Historical_Ad4384,2025-05-25 15:20:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kv520y/decentralised_vs_distributed_architecture_for_etl/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-05-25 15:20:26,15,Sunday,385.0,2330,41.53,13,606,15.4,0,1

1kvbr5b,"Learning About GCP BigQuery Table Schema - Please help me understand the real world use cases of when and how often you use ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" and ""normalized relational schema"" when constructing your GCP BigQuery tables.","**Question:**

I am currently learning Google Cloud Platform for data engineering. I learned that there are three types of schemas that I can use when constructing tables in BigQuery: 1) Normalized relational schema, 2) Nested & Repeating Schema, 3) Denormalized schema. I am trying to understand when I will realistically use ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" instead of ""normalized relational schema"" for the tables that I construct in BigQuery.



Please answer both of these questions below:

1. When do you use ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" over ""normalized relational schema"" when you construct tables in BigQuery?

2. When constructing tables within BigQuery data warehouses, how often do you use ""Nested & Repeating Schema""? How often do you use ""normalized relational schema""? If possible, please provide me a ballpark percentage (Ex. 40% Nested & Repeating Schema vs. 60% normalized relational schema).

  


**My Current Rationale:**

I understand that BigQuery is a columnar oriented database. I learned that ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" is a more cost-effective for querying and more efficient than ""normalized relational schema"". However, even after researching it, I do not fully understand the real life advantages of ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" over a ""normalized relational schema"".

Although ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" is more efficient and cost-effective for querying, I think a ""normalized relational schema"" makes more sense because it allows you to update records more easily like a traditional SQL RDBMS.

I understand that columnar oriented databases are great when your historical data within the BigQuery table does not change. However, from my experience on working as a data analyst, historical data frequently needs to change. For example, lets say you have an external OLTP RDBMS that feeds into BigQuery daily. This external OLTP RDBMS contains a table named sales data. This table contains a column named ""Member Status"" and returns either one of two outputs: ""Active"" or ""Inactive"". ""Member ID"" 123456 has a ""Member Status"" of ""Active"". The data for that daily load is sent from the external OLTP RDBMS to the BigQuery table containing the data of ""Member ID"" 123456 with a ""Member Status"" of ""Active"". Three months later, the ""Member Status"" of ""Member ID"" 123456 changes to ""Inactive"" within the external OLTP RDBMS.

From my understanding, now I cannot change that data easily within the BigQuery table if it has ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" . If my BigQuery table had ""normalized relational schema"", it should be able to update the ""Member Status"" of ""Member ID"" 123456 very easily.

This is my rationale on why I think a ""normalized relational schema"" is better than ""Nested & Repeating Schema"" for the majority of real world use cases. 

Please let me know if you agree, disagree, etc. I would love to hear your thoughts. I am still learning GCP and data engineering.

I’m currently finishing my Master's in Data Science and will officially graduate in June next year. I’ll have about a month of free time coming up, and I want to use it wisely to break into data engineering.

Study for and pass a Microsoft-certified data engineering exam (probably the DP-203 – Azure Data Engineer Associate).

Start a small ETL/data pipeline project with a few friends, maybe deploy it on the cloud (Azure or AWS) and publish everything on GitHub.

1kw25lj,"The skills no one teaches engineers: mindset, people smarts, and the books that rewired me","I got laid off from Amazon after COVID when they outsourced our BI team to India and replaced half our workflow with automation. The ones who stayed weren’t better at SQL or Python - they just had better people skills. 

For two months, I applied to every job on LinkedIn and heard nothing. Then I stopped. I laid in bed, doomscrolled 5+ hours a day, and watched my motivation rot. I thought I was just tired. Then my girlfriend left me - and that cracked something open.

In that heartbreak haze, I realized something brutal: I hadn’t grown in years. Since college, I hadn’t finished a single book - five whole years of mental autopilot. 

Meanwhile, some of my friends - people who foresaw the layoffs, the AI boom, the chaos - were now running startups, freelancing like pros, or negotiating raises with confidence. What did they all have in common? They never stop self growth and they read. Daily.

So I ran a stupid little experiment: finish one book. Just one. I picked a memoir that mirrored my burnout. Then another. Then I tried a business book. Then a psychology one. I kept going. It’s been 7 months now, and I’m not the same person.

Reading daily didn’t just help me “get smarter.” It reprogrammed how I think. My mindset, work ethic, even how I speak in interviews - it all changed. I want to share this in case someone else out there feels as stuck and brain-fogged as I did. You’re not lazy. You just need better inputs. Start feeding your mind again.

As someone with ADHD, reading daily wasn’t easy at first. My brain wanted dopamine, not paragraphs. I’d reread the same page five times. That’s why these tools helped - they made learning actually stick, even on days I couldn’t sit still. Here’s what worked for me:
- The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: This book completely rewired how I think about wealth, happiness, and leverage. Naval’s mindset is pure clarity.

- Principles by Ray Dalio: The founder of Bridgewater lays out the rules he used to build one of the biggest hedge funds in the world. It’s not just about work - it’s about how to think. Easily one of the most eye-opening books I’ve ever read.

- Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins: NYT Bestseller. His brutal honesty about trauma and self-discipline lit a fire in me. This book will slap your excuses in the face.

- Deep Work by Cal Newport: Productivity bible. Made me rethink how shallow my work had become. Best book on regaining focus in a distracted world.

- The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel:  Super digestible. Helped me stop making emotional money decisions. Best finance book I’ve ever read, period.


Other tools & podcasts that helped 
- Lenny’s Newsletter: the best newsletter if you're in tech or product. Lenny (ex-Airbnb PM) shares real frameworks, growth tactics, and hiring advice. It's like free mentorship from a top-tier operator.

- BeFreed: A friend who worked at Google put me on this. It’s a smart reading & book summary app that lets you customize how you read/listen: 10 min skims, 40 min deep dives, 20 min podcast-style explainers, or flashcards to help stuff actually stick. 

it also remembers your favs, highlights, goals and recommend books that best fit your goal.

 I tested it on books I’d already read and the deep dives covered ~80% of the key ideas. Now I finished 10+ books per month and I recommend it to all my friends who never had time or energy to read daily.

- Ash: A friend told me about this when I was totally burnt out. It’s like therapy-lite for work stress - quick check-ins, calming tools, and mindset prompts that actually helped me feel human again.

- The Tim Ferriss Show - podcast – Endless value bombs. He interviews top performers and always digs deep into their habits and books.

Tbh, I used to think reading was just a checkbox for “smart” people. Now I see it as survival. It’s how you claw your way back when your mind is broken.

If you’re burnt out, heartbroken, or just numb - don’t wait for motivation. Pick up any book that speaks to what you’re feeling. Let it rewire you. Let it remind you that people before you have already written the answers.

I wanted to start a conversation about the growing expectation for data professionals to become more ""full-stack."" Especially in the Brazilian market, I've noticed a trend, or even a pressure, for people to take on more responsibilities across the entire data workflow, sometimes beyond their original role.

I’ve been working as a Data Engineer for a little over a year now, focusing mainly on EL processes, building data pipelines and delivering datasets to the primary layer. From there, Analytics Engineers usually take over and apply transformations. I hold certifications in Airflow (Astronomer) and Databricks Data Engineer Fundamentals, and I’m currently thinking about diving into DBT, mainly through personal projects.

With cloud, I faced challenges like unpredictable performance, latency in site-to-site flows, compliance concerns, and hidden costs with high-throughput workloads. Even private cloud didn’t give me the level of control I need for debugging, tuning, and data governance.

1kvqajs,How to know which files have already been loaded into my data warehouse?,"_Context: I'm a professional software engineer, but mostly self-taught in the world of data engineering. So there are probably things I don't know that I don't know! I've been doing this for about 8 years but only recently learned about DBT and SQLMesh, for example._

I'm working on an ELT pipeline that converts input files of various formats into Parquet files on Google Cloud Storage, which subsequently need to be loaded into BigQuery tables (append-only).

- The Extract processes drop files into GCS at unspecified times.

- The Transform processes convert _newly created_ files to Parquet and drops the result back into GCS.

- The Load process needs to load the _newly created_ files into BigQuery, making sure to load every file exactly once.

To process only new (or failed) files, I guess there are two main approaches:

1. Query the output, see what's missing, then process that. Seems simple, but has scalability limitations because you need to list the entire history. Would need to query both GCS and BQ to compare what files are still missing.

2. Have some external system or work queue that keeps track of incomplete work. Scales better, but has the potential to go out of sync with reality (e.g. if Extract fails to write to the work queue, the file is never transformed or loaded).

I suppose this is a common problem that everyone has solved already. What are the best practices around this?

1kvsdt5,How does create or replace table work exactly in BigQuery (table got deleted in STG using DBT),"So first of all, it's not ""urgent"", this happened in a non prod environment, while running tests.

I don't know if DBT did this or if it was me hitting the task on airflow to run a model two times in a row.

We have an airflow connected to DBT using astronomer. One of our models is a simple materialized = table model.

I was testing some changes in it and hit the clear task in airflow, maybe I did it twice, I don't know. But checking the BigQuery job logs, I can see that the query was tried two times, within 20 seconds of each other, this particular query takes around 1 minute to run, but this change I made had a partitioning error, so it failed very quickly with error **\[PARTITION BY expression must be DATE(<timestamp\_column>) etc...\]**. timestamps for creation and end time for both queries were:

|| || |2025-05-25 13:00:35.436000 UTC|2025-05-25 13:00:36.598000 UTC |

|| || |2025-05-25 13:00:55.847000 UTC|2025-05-25 13:00:56.810000 UTC |

The table definitely existed previous to 2025-05-25 13:00:35.436000 UTC, we test on it all the time. I went to check the table in stg today and it doesn't exist anymore.

I don't know if it matters but the SA that uses DBT was also running other jobs/queries in bigquery, non related to dbt, but those other jobs started 1 minute after my DBT queries were tried, probably doesn't affect this whole thing.

My questions are:

1. **how on earth did this happen? Is it possible that during CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE the table was dropped and not recreated, because of the invalidQuery? How does CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE work under the hood?**
2. **Can I recover a deleted table like this in the future? I worry about this happening in PRD environment - I don't need to recover this one, I can just re run the DBT model with the correct partition and it's fine, after all it's a materialized = table model and I have the data to repopulate it. I worry about this happening on incremental models in the future, though.**

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I found out that, a few milliseconds before the CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE took place, there was a delete request (saw it in the log explorer), by the same service account that DBT uses, I'm assuming DBT did this?

1kvw9hm,Why YAML is actually a great fit for collaborative data testing,"The real blocker in achieving good data quality is not only code, but ineffective teamwork (or no teamwork at all).

For example:

* Data producers (engineers) often don’t know the full downstream data needs.
* Data consumers (analysts, stakeholders) often *do*, but they can’t enforce it.
* Slack back-and-forths, manual QA, broken dashboards.



We can imagine a healthy alternative for data collaboration, where data issues can be **understood, defined,** and **detected** across a team, and then the actual collaboration friction can be significantly reduced.



So, what does this have to do with YAML? 

Well, by adapting YAML into a data quality checks framework, we will get a simple, accurate, and effective **data collaboration model** which allows us to have:

* A clean, declarative way to define data expectations.
* Non-engineers to contribute checks and proposals.
* Business logic flows more naturally in the data pipeline based on quantifiable data expectations.
* Actual data accountability that is visible and traceable.



That's what a properly structured and designed YAML-based framework can achieve. 

As a result, we will have more people involved in testing → issues being caught earlier, which leads to less friction, fewer surprises. What do you think?

FWIW, I work at Soda and we’ve leaned pretty hard into YAML for this reason. Happy to share more examples if folks are interested.",0,6,LucaMakeTime,2025-05-26 14:49:41,https://i.redd.it/xtzlr8yn053f1.png,0,False,False,False,False,2025-05-26 14:49:41,14,Monday,221.0,1412,48.6,15,357,11.7,0,0

Many data consumers may view DE teams as a bottleneck who slow down the data delivery process, instead the people managing the natural bottlenecks in enterprise data management.

1kvw9nn,🚀 What Are Containers in Tech? (Explained Simply + Why They're Changing Everything),"# ✅ Introduction: What If Software Just Worked… Everywhere?

Have you ever built something that ran perfectly on your computer—only to watch it crash on someone else’s machine?  
That age-old problem has a modern solution: **containers**.

In this post, you'll discover **what containers are**, **how they work**, and **why they're revolutionizing software development, cloud computing, and DevOps workflows**. Whether you're a curious beginner, a developer, or a tech leader, this is your ultimate beginner-to-pro guide.

# 🧠 What Are Containers? (In One Clear Sentence)

**A container** is a lightweight, portable unit that packages your application **along with everything it needs to run**—so it behaves exactly the same across different computers, servers, and environments.

# 🔁 Think of it as:

>

# 🔍 Why Do Containers Matter in 2025?

Containers are at the **heart of modern app development**. They power everything from **microservices** to **cloud-native architectures** and **CI/CD pipelines**. Giants like Netflix, Google, Spotify, and Airbnb use containers to deploy faster, scale instantly, and recover from failures in seconds.

# 📈 Real-world impact:

* **Faster deployments**
* **Lower costs**
* **Zero configuration issues**
* **Massive scalability**

# 📦 How Containers Actually Work (Simplified)

Let’s break it down:

1. You write an app.
2. You create a **container image** using tools like **Docker**.
3. This image includes your app **+ libraries, code, settings, runtime, dependencies**.
4. You launch the image → it becomes a **container** running independently on any system.

✅ The secret sauce?

# ⚖️ Containers vs. Virtual Machines (VMs)

|Feature|Containers 🐳|Virtual Machines 🖥️|
|:-|:-|:-|
|OS Overhead|Minimal|Full OS per VM|
|Startup Time|Seconds|Minutes|
|Portability|Extremely portable|Less portable|
|Isolation|Process-level|Full hardware-level|
|Performance|High|Moderate|

>

# 🛠️ Popular Tools You Should Know

* **Docker** – The most popular container platform
* **Kubernetes** – Manages containers at scale
* **Podman** – A secure alternative to Docker
* **Containerd** – A high-performance container runtime

# 🧙 Real-Life Analogy: Cooking with Containers

Imagine you're a chef. You have a recipe that works perfectly in *your* kitchen.

But when you travel to a new city, you're in someone else's kitchen:

* No garlic?
* Oven too hot?
* Tools missing?

🤯 The result: your food is inconsistent.

Now imagine carrying **your entire kitchen inside a suitcase**—with your spices, knives, and perfect oven. You unpack it anywhere, cook your signature dish, and it **tastes exactly the same.**

That’s what containers do for software.  
**Portable, repeatable, reliable**.

# 🎯 Benefits of Using Containers

✔ **Run anywhere** – Cloud, local, Windows, Linux—it just works.  
✔ **Speed up development** – Spin up dev environments in seconds.  
✔ **Improve collaboration** – “Works on my machine” becomes “Works everywhere.”  
✔ **Simplify deployment** – One artifact to deploy across all environments.  
✔ **Scale effortlessly** – Run hundreds of containers in parallel with tools like Kubernetes.

|:-|:-|
|""Containers are like VMs""|They share the OS kernel, not the entire OS|
|""Containers are secure by default""|You must harden container environments|
|""Containers can store app data""|**statelessvolumes**Containers are   unless you use  |

# 💡 Real-World Use Cases

* **Microservices architecture** – Break large apps into small, independently deployable services.
* **CI/CD pipelines** – Use containers to test and deploy code faster.
* **Hybrid cloud** – Move workloads across clouds seamlessly.
* **Dev environments** – Onboard new developers in minutes.

# 🚀 Final Takeaway

**Containers have become the building blocks of modern software.**  
They’re not just a trend—they’re a necessity for teams that want to move fast, stay agile, and build reliable systems in today’s cloud-first world.

If you're not using containers yet, you're leaving speed, consistency, and innovation on the table.

1kwy13s,"$10,000 annually for 500MB daily pipeline?","Just found out our IT department contracted a pipeline build that moves 500MB daily. They're pretending to manage data (insert long story about why they shouldn't). It's costing our business $10,000 per year. 

Granted that comes with theoretical support and maintenance. I'd estimate the vendor spends maybe 1-6 hours per year doing support. 

They don't know what value the company derives from it so they ask me every year about it. It does generate more value than it costs.

I'm just wondering if this is even reasonable? We have over a hundred various systems that we need to incorporate as topics into the ""warehouse"" this IT team purchased from another vendor (it's highly immutable so really any ETL is just filling other databases in the same server). They did this stuff in like 2021-2022 and have yet to extend further, including building pipelines for the other sources. At this rate, we'll be paying millions of dollars to manage the full suite (plus whatever custom build charges hit upfront) of ETL, no even compute or storage. The $10k isn't for cloud, it's all on prem on our computer and storage.

There's probably implementation details I'm leaving out. Just wondering if this is reasonable.

1kw9ku2,Group by on large dataset [Over 1 TB],"Hi everyone, I'm currently using an NVIDIA Tesla V100  32GB with CUDF to do som transformation on a dataset. The response  time for the operations I'm doing is good, however, I'm wondering what is the best approach to do some grouping operations in some SQL database.  Assuming I'm allowed to create a DB architecture from scratch, what is my best option? Is Indexing a good idea or is there something else (better) for my use case?

Thanks in advance.

  
EDIT: Thank you very much for the response to all of you,  I tried Clickhouse as many of you suggested and holy cow, it is insane what it does. I didn't bulk all the data into the DB yet, but I tried with a subset of 145 GB, and got the following metrics: 

465 rows in set. Elapsed: 4.333 sec. **Processed 1.23 billion rows**, 47.36 GB (284.16 million rows/s., 10.93 GB/s.). Peak memory usage: 302.26 KiB.

  
I'm not sure if there is any way to even improve the response time, but I think I'm good with what I got. By the way, the database is pretty simple:

1kwy2ef,Tips to create schemas for data?,"Hi, I am not sure if I can ask this so please let me know if it is not right to do so.

I am currently working on setting up Trino to query data stored in Hadoop (+Hive Metastore) to eventually query data to BI tools. Lets say my current data is currently stored in as /meters name/sub-meters name/multiple time-series.parquet:

\`\`\`

/meters/

meter1/

meter1a/

part-\*.parquet

meter1b/

part-\*.parquet

meter2/

meter2a/

part-\*.parquet

...

\`\`\`

Each sub-meter has different columns (mixed data types) to each one another.  and there are around 20 sub-meters

I can think of 2 ways to set up schemas in hive metastore:

\- create multiple tables for each meter + add partitions by year-month-day (optional). Create views to combine tables to query data from and manually add meter names as a new column.

\- Use long format and create general partitions such as meter/sub-meters:

|timestamp|meter|sub\_meter|metric\_name|metric\_value (DOUBLE)|metric\_text (STRING)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2024-01-01 00:00:00|meter1|meter1a|voltage|220.5|NULL|
|2024-01-01 00:00:00|meter1|meter1a|status|NULL|""OK""|

The second one seems more practical but I am not sure if it is a proper way to store data. Any advice?

Or more strategic (e.g., cost-saving strategies, managing flows across regulated environments)?

- Who usually owns these problems in your world — data engineers, platform teams, DevOps?
- Where do you usually go for info like this — Reddit, Slack communities, LinkedIn groups, or something else?

1kwqxv0,"Advices on tooling (Airflow, Nifi)","Hi everyone!

I am working in a small company (we're 3/4 in the tech department), with a lot of integrations to make with external providers/consumers (we're in the field of telemetry).

I have set up an Airflow that works like a charm in order to orchestrate existing scripts (as a replacement of old crontabs basically).

However, we have a lot of data processing to setup, pulling data from servers, splitting xml entries, formatting, conversion into JSON, read/Write into cache, updates with DBs, API calls, etc...

I have tried running Nifi on a single container, and it took some time before I understood the approach but I'm starting to see how powerful it is.

  
However, I feel like it's a real struggle to maintain:  
   - I couldn't manage to have it run behind an nginx so far (SNI issues) in the docker-compose context
   - I find documentation to be really thin
   - Interface can be confusing, naming of processors also
   - Not that many tutorials/walkthrough, and many stackoverflow answers aren't 

I wanted to try it in order to replace old scripts and avoid technical debt, but I am feeling like NiFi might not be super easy to maintain.

I am wondering if keeping digging into Nifi is worth the pain, if managing the flows can be easy to integrate on the long run or if Nifi is definitely made for bigger teams with strong processes?
Maybe we should stick to Airflow as it has more support and is more widespread?
Also, any feedback on NifiKop in order to run it in kubernetes?

I am also up for any suggestion!

Thank you very much!

It was running on Oracle, by the way. He mentioned that using DBT led to the creation of many more steps or models, since best practices in DBT often encourage breaking large SQL scripts into smaller, modular ones. However, he also said this made the process slower overall, because the Oracle query optimizer tends to perform better with larger, consolidated SQL queries than with many smaller ones.

1kxmcb2,Decentralized compute for AI is starting to feel less like a dream and more like a necessity,"Been thinking a lot about how broken access to computing has become in AI.

We’ve reached a point where training and inference demand insane GPU power, but almost everything is gated behind AWS, GCP, and Azure. If you’re a startup, indie dev, or research lab, good luck affording it. Even if you can, there’s the compliance overhead, opaque usage policies, and the quiet reality that all your data and models sit in someone else’s walled garden.

This centralization creates 3 big issues:

* Cost barriers lock out innovation
* Surveillance and compliance risks go up
* Local/grassroots AI development gets stifled

I came across a project recently, Ocean Nodes, that proposes a decentralized alternative. The idea is to create a permissionless compute layer where anyone can contribute idle GPUs or CPUs. Developers can run containerized workloads (training, inference, validation), and everything is cryptographically verified. It’s essentially DePIN combined with AI workloads.

Not saying it solves everything overnight, but it flips the model: instead of a few hyperscalers owning all the compute, we can build a network where anyone contributes and anyone can access. Trust is built in by design, not by paperwork.

Has anyone here tried running AI jobs on decentralized infrastructure or looked into Ocean Nodes? Does this kind of model actually have legs for serious ML workloads?

I have never used it further than a PoC though because my company uses a lot of Python for data processing. Some of it could be replaced with SQL but some of it is text processing with Python NLP libraries which I wouldn’t know how to do in SQL. And dbt Python models are only available for some cloud database services while we use Postgres on-prem, so no go here.

Now finally for the question: can you point me to software/frameworks that
- allow Python code execution
- build a DAG like dbt and only execute what is required
- offer versioning where you could „go back in time“ to obtain the state of data like it was half a year before
- offer a graphical view of the DAG
- offer data lineage 
- help with project structure and are not overly complicated

1kxe0l5,Data Migration in Modernization Projects Still Feels Broken — How Are You Solving Governance & Validation?,"Hey folks,

We’re seeing a pattern across modernization efforts: **Data migration** — especially when moving from legacy monoliths to microservices or SaaS architectures — is still **painfully ad hoc**.

Sure, the core ELT pipeline can be wired up with AWS tools like **DMS**, **Glue**, and **Airflow**. But we keep running into these *repetitive, unsolved pain points*:

* Pre-migration risk profiling (null ratios, low-entropy fields, unexpected schema drift)
* Field-level data lineage from source → target
* Dry run simulations for pre-launch sign-off
* Post-migration validation (hash diffs, rules, anomaly checks)
* Data owner/steward approvals (governance checkpoints)
* Observability and traceability when things go wrong

We’ve had to script or manually patch this stuff over and over — across different clients and environments. Which made us wonder:

# Are These Just Gaps in the Ecosystem?

We're trying to validate:

* Are others running into these same repeatable challenges?
* How are you handling governance, validation, and observability in migrations?
* If you’ve extended the AWS-native stack, how did you approach things like steward approvals or validation logic?
* Has anyone tried solving this at the **platform level** — e.g., a reusable layer over AWS services, or even a standalone open-source toolset?
* If AWS-native isn't enough, what **open-source options** could form the foundation of a more robust migration framework?

We’re not trying to pitch anything — just seriously considering whether these pain points are universal enough to justify a more structured solution (possibly even SaaS/platform-level). Would love to learn how others are approaching it.

1kxo58r,"Sequor: An open source SQL-centric framework for API integrations (like ""dbt for app integration"")","**TL;DR:** Open source ""dbt for API integration"" - SQL-centric, git-friendly, no vendor lock-in. Code-first approach to API workflows.

Hey r/dataengineering,

We built Sequor to solve a recurring problem: choosing between two bad options for API/app integration:

1. Proprietary black-box SaaS connectors with vendor lock-in
2. Custom scripts that are brittle, opaque, and hard to maintain

As data engineers, we wanted a solution that followed the principles that made dbt so powerful (code-first, git-based version control, SQL-centric), but designed specifically for API integration workflows.

**What Sequor does:**

* Connects APIs to your databases with an iterator model
* Uses SQL for all data transformations and preparation
* Defines workflows in YAML with proper version control
* Adds procedural flow control (if-then-else, for-each loops)
* Uses Python and Jinja for dynamic parameters and response mapping

**Quick example:** 

* Data acquisition: Pull Salesforce leads → transform with SQL → push to HubSpot → all in one declarative pipeline.
* Data activation (Reverse ETL): Pull customer behavior from warehouse → segment with SQL → sync personalized offers to Klaviyo/Mailchimp
* App integration: Pull new orders from Amazon → join with SQL to identify new customers → create the customers and sales orders in NetSuite
* App integration: Pull inventory levels from NetSuite → filter with SQL for eBay-active SKUs → update quantities on eBay

**How it's different from other tools:**

Instead of choosing between rigid and incomplete prebuilt integration systems, you can easily build your own custom connectors in minutes using just two basic operations (**transform** for SQL and **http\_request** for APIs) and starting from prebuilt examples we provide.

The project is open source and we welcome any feedback and contributions.

1kxsxqv,Integrating GA4 + BigQuery into AWS-based Data Stack for Marketplace Analytics – Facing ETL Challenges,"
Hey everyone,

I’m working as a data engineer at a large marketplace company. We process over 3 million transactions per month and receive more than 20 million visits to our website monthly.

We’re currently trying to integrate data from Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and BigQuery into our AWS-based architecture, where we use S3, Redshift, dbt, and Tableau for analytics and reporting.

However, we’re running into some issues with the ETL process — especially when dealing with the semi-structured NoSQL-like GA4 data in BigQuery. We’ve successfully flattened the arrays into a tabular model, but the resulting tables are huge — both in terms of columns and rows — and we can’t run dbt models efficiently on top of them.

We attempted to create intermediate, smaller tables in BigQuery to reduce complexity before loading into AWS, but this introduced an extra transformation layer that we’d rather avoid, as it complicates the pipeline and maintainability.

I’d like to implement an incremental model in dbt, but I’m not sure if that’s going to be effective given the way the GA4 data is structured and the performance bottlenecks we’ve hit so far.

Has anyone here faced similar challenges with integrating GA4 data into an AWS ecosystem?

How did you handle the schema explosion and performance issues with dbt/Redshift?

Any thoughts on best practices or architecture patterns would be really appreciated.

1kxp4f6,Apache Beam windowing question,"Hi everyone,

  
I'm working on a small project where I'm taking some stock ticker data, and streaming it into GCP BigQuery using DataFlow. I'm completely new to Apache Beam so I've been wrapping my head around the programming model and windowing system and have some queries about how best to implement what I'm going for. At source I'm recieving typical OHLC (open, high, low, close) data every minute and I want to compute various rolling metrics on the close attribute for things like rolling averages etc. Currently the only way I see forward is to use sliding windows to calculate these aggregated metrics. The problem is that a rolling average of a few days being updated every minute for each new incoming row would result in shedloads of sliding windows being held at any given moment which feels like a horribly inefficient load of duplication of the same basic data. 

I'm also curious about attributes which you don't neccessarily want to aggregate and how you reconcile that with your rolling metrics. It feels like everything leans so heavily into using windowing that the only way to get the unaggregated attributes such as open/high/low is by sorting the whole window by timestamp and then finding the latest entry, which again feels like a rather ugly and inefficient way of doing things. Is there not some way to leave some attributes out of the sliding window entirely since they're all going to be written at the same frequency anyways? I understand the need for windowing when data can often be unordered but it feels like things get exceedingly complicated if you don't want to use the same aggregation window for all your attributes.

  
Should I stick with my current direction, is there a better way to do this sort of thing in Beam or should I really be using Spark for this sort of job? Would love to hear the thoughts of people with more of a clue than myself.",2,1,JG3_Luftwaffle,2025-05-28 18:49:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kxp4f6/apache_beam_windowing_question/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-05-28 18:49:49,18,Wednesday,328.0,1888,49.69,11,478,13.6,0,0

So for our ML models we are designing secure data engineering. For our ML use cases we would require data with and without customer PII.

1kxgb8j,"How do you balance the demands of ""Nested & Repeating"" schema while keeping query execution costs low? I am facing a dilemma where I want to use ""Nested & Repeating"" schema, but I should also consider using partitioning and clustering to make my query executions more cost-effective.","**Context:**

I am currently learning data engineering and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

I am currently constructing an OLAP data warehouse within BigQuery so data analysts can create Power BI reports.

The example OLAP table is:  
\* Member ID (Not repeating. Primary Key)

\* Member Status (Can repeat. Is an array)

\* Date Modified (Can repeat. Is an array)

\* Sold Date (Can repeat. Is an array)

I am facing a rookie dilemma - I highly prefer to use ""nested & repeating"" schema because I like how everything is organized with this schema. However, I should also consider partitioning and clustering the data because it will reduce query execution costs. It seems like I can only partition and cluster the data if I use a ""denormalized"" schema. I am not a fan of ""denormalized"" schema because I think it can duplicate some records, which will confuse analysts and inflate data. (Ex. The last thing I want is for a BigQuery table to inflate revenue per Member ID.).

**Question:**

My questions are this:

1) In your data engineering job, when constructing OLAP data warehouse tables for data analysis, do you ever use partitioning and clustering?

2) Do you always use ""nested & repeating"" schema, or do you sometimes use ""denormalized schema"" if you need to partition and cluster columns?

1kxf2ip,Everyone’s talking about LLMs — but the real power comes when you pair them with structured and semantic search.,"https://reddit.com/link/1kxf2ip/video/b77h5x55fi3f1/player

We’re seeing more and more scenarios where structured/semi-structured search (SQL, Mongo, etc.) must be combined with semantic search (vector, sentiment) to unlock real value.  
  
Take one of our recent projects:

The client wanted to analyze marketing campaign performance by asking flexible, natural questions — from: ""What’s the sentiment around campaign X?"" to ""Pull all clicks by ID and visualize engagement over time on the fly.  
  
""Can't we just plug in an LLM and call it a day?  
  
Well — simple integration with OpenAI (or any LLM) won't suffice.  
ChatGPT out of the box might seem to offer both fuzzy and structured queries.   
  
But without seamless integration with:

\- Vector search (to find contextually appropriate semantic data)

\- SQL/NoSQL databases (to access exact, structured/semi-structured data)…you'll soon find yourself limited.

Here’s why:  
  
1. Size limits – LLMs cannot natively consume or reason on enormous datasets. You need to get the proper slice of data ahead of time.  
2. Determinism – There is a chance that ""calculate total value since June"" will give you different answers, even if temperature = 0. SQL will not.  
3. Speed limits – LLMs are not built for rapid high-scale data queries or real-time dashboards.  
  
In this demo, I’m showing you exactly how we solve this with a dedicated AI analytics agent for B2B review intelligence:  
  
Agent Setup  
Role: You are a B2B review analytics assistant — your mission is to answer any user query using one of two expert tools:  
  
Vector Search Tool — Powered by Azure AI Search  
\- Handles semantic/sentiment understanding- Ideal for open-ended questions like ""what do users think of XYZ tool?""  
\- Interprets the user’s intent and generates relevant vector search queries  
\- Used when the input is subjective, descriptive, or fuzzy  
  
Semi-Structured Search Tool — Powered by MongoDB  
\- Handles precise lookups, aggregations, and stats  
\- Ideal for prompts like ""show reviews where RAG tools are mentioned"" or ""average rating by technology""  
\- Dynamically builds Mongo queries based on schema and request context  
\- Falls back to vector search if the structure doesn’t match but context is still relevant (e.g., tool names or technologies mentioned)  
  
As a result with have hybrid AI agent that reasons like an analyst but behaves like an engineer — fast, reliable, and context-aware.",0,6,Awkward-Bug-5686,2025-05-28 11:50:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kxf2ip/everyones_talking_about_llms_but_the_real_power/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-05-28 11:50:58,11,Wednesday,377.0,2465,50.06,17,567,12.9,1,0

1l2fuol,How do I build great data infrastructure and team?,"I recently finished my degree in Computer Science and worked part-time throughout my studies, including on many personal projects in the data domain. I’m very confident in my technical skills: I can (and have) built large systems and my own SaaS projects. I know all the ins and outs of the basic data-engineering tools, SQL, Python, Pandas, PySpark, and have experience with the entire software-engineering stack (Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes, even front-end). I also have a solid grasp of statistics.

About a year ago, I was hired at a company that had previously outsourced all IT to external firms. I got the job through the CEO of a company where I’d interned previously. He’s now the CTO of this new company and is building the entire IT department from scratch. The reason he was hired is to transform this traditional company, whose industry is being significantly disrupted by tech, into a “tech” company. You can really tell the CEO cares about that: in a little over one year, we’ve grown to 15+ developers, and the culture has changed a lot.

I now have the privilege of being trusted with the responsibility of building the entire data infrastructure from scratch. I have total authority over all tech decisions, although I don’t have much experience with how mature data teams operate. Since I’m a total open-source nerd and we’re based in Europe, we want to rely on as few American cloud providers as possible, I’ve set up the current infrastructure like this:

* **Airflow** (running in our Kubernetes cluster)
* **ClickHouse DWH** (also running in our Kubernetes cluster)
* **Spark** (you guessed it, running in our cluster)
* **Goose** for SQL migrations in our warehouse

Some conceptual decisions I’ve made so far:

1. Data ingestion from different sources (Salesforce, multiple products, etc.) runs through Airflow, using simple Pandas scripts to load into the DWH (about 200 k rows per day).
2. ClickHouse is our DWH, and Spark connects to ClickHouse so that all analytics runs through Spark against ClickHouse. If you have any tips on how to structure the different data layers (Ingestion/datamart etc), please!

What I want to implement next are typical software-engineering practices, dev/prod environments, testing, etc. As I mentioned, I have a lot of experience in classical SWE within corporate environments, so I want to apply as much from that as possible. In my research, I’ve found that you basically just copy the entire environment for dev and prod, which makes sense, but sounds expensive computing wise. We will soon start hiring additional DE/DA/DS.

My question is: What technical or organizational decisions do you think are important and valuable? What have you seen work (or not work) in your experience as a data engineer? Are there problems you only discover once your team has grown? I want to get in front of those issues as early as possible. Like I said, I have a lot of experience in how to build SWE projects in a corporate environment. Any things I am not thinking about that will sooner or later come to haunt me in my DE team?

I’m a junior Data Engineer with about 1 year of experience working with Snowflake in a large-scale retail project (Inditex). I studied Computer Engineering and recently completed a Master’s in Big Data. I got decent grades, but I wasn’t top of my class — not good enough to unlock prestigious scholarships or academic opportunities.

	•	Are certifications (like the Snowflake one) worth it for standing out?
	•	Would a private master’s or MBA from a well-known school help open doors, even if I’m not doing it for the learning itself? If so, which ones are actually respected in the data world?
	•	I’m also working on personal projects (investment tools, dashboards) that I use for myself and publish on GitHub. Is it worth adapting them for the public or making them more portfolio-ready?

I’d love to hear from others who were in a similar position: what helped you stand out? What do hiring managers and companies actually value when considering junior profiles?

1l2sbm1,How Do You Organize A PySpark/Databricks Project,"Hey all,

I've been learning Spark/PySpark recently and I'm curious about how production projects are typically structured and organized.

My background is in DBT, where each model (table/view) is defined in a SQL file, and DBT builds a DAG automatically using `ref()` calls. For example:

    -- modelB.sql
    SELECT colA FROM {{ ref('modelA') }}
    

This ensures `modelA` runs before `modelB`. DBT handles the dependency graph for you, parallelizes independent models for faster builds, and allows for targeted runs using tags. It also supports automated tests defined in YAML files, which run before the associated models.

I'm wondering how similar functionality is achieved in Databricks. Is lineage managed manually, or is there a framework to define dependencies and parallelism? How are tests defined and automatically executed? I'd also like to understand how this works in vanilla Spark without Databricks.

  
TLDR - How are Databricks or vanilla Spark projects organized in production. How are things like 100s of tables, lineage/DAGs, orchestration, and tests managed?

1l2l19x,snowpark vs ibis,"I'm in the middle of choosing a dataframe framework to communicate with my cloud database. The setup is that we have to use python and snowflake. I'm not sure about what to use snowpark or ibis.  
  
**ibis**  
Ibis definitely has the advantage of choosing more than 20 backends. In the case of a migration that would become handy.  
The local testing capabilities are to be found out. If I would set up a local duck db I could test locally, with the same behaviour in duckdb and snowflake. The down sites are that I would have another dependency (ibis) and most probably not all features are implemented that snowflake provides. f.e UDTF.

**snowflake**  
The worst/clostest coupling to snowflake. I have no option to choose a backend but I have all the capabilites and if I dont snowflakes customer support would most likely help me.

If I dont need the capability of multiple backends, it is an unnessesary abstraction layer

1l2l5ax,"infrastructure suggestions for streaming data into ""point in time"" redshift data warehouse with low data volume","Im looking for suggestions on what infrastructure and techniques to use to achieve these requirements. I want to keep it simple, easy to maintain and understand. I dont need scalability at this time.

I have a requirement to design a data warehouse in redshift that supports the ability to query past data states similarly to temporal tables in MS SQL Server. (if an update query is made, I need to be able to query for what the table looked like before the update) this is sometimes called ""time travel query"" or ""point in time architecture"" depending on your background. The data sources do not retain this historical data, and are not in an ideal data warehouse schema, so Ill need to transform the data either before or after loading it, and maintain the historical records. Redshift seems to lack a direct solution for this problem.

a second requirement is to ingest the data using streaming technology such as kafka. though the data warehouse does not have to be updated in real time. that is optional.

I have looked at redshift's ""history mode"" but its quite new and it looks like all the data would need to go into RDS first, which has tradeoffs. but one of the main data sources is already on RDS, so that seems promising.

total data volume is low, no need for cluster computing if we can save some complexity.

I would prefer to lean toward python and sql for programming.

I would prefer to do things in real-time, but would accept batches if a particularly elegant solution is available.

1l2pg9g,Agree with this data modeling approach?,"Hey yall,

  
I stumbled upon this linkedin post today and thought it was really insightful and well written, but I'm getting tripped up on the idea that wide tables are inherently bad within the silver layer. I'm by no means an expert and would like to make sure I'm understanding the concept first. 

Is this article claiming that if I have, say, a dim\_customers table, that to widen that table with customer attributes like location, sign up date, size, etc. that I will create a brittle architecture? To me this seems like a standard practice, as long as you are maintaining the grain of the table (1 customer per record). I also might use this table to join in all of the ids from various source systems. This makes it easy to investigate issues and increases the tables reusability IMO.

Am I misunderstanding the article maybe, or is there a better, more scalable approach than what I'm currently doing in my own work?

KPI 1: Implement comprehensive data security assessments for 100% of critical systems containing \[product\] identification numbers (VINs), customer financial data, and connected \[product\] data within 1 year.  
Metric: % of critical data systems that have undergone a complete security assessment

KPI 2: Reduce security vulnerabilities in dealership management systems (DMS) by 40% through enhanced validation controls that prevent SQL injection and unauthorized access to customer and vehicle records.  
Metric: % reduction in identified security vulnerabilities

KPI 3: Implement role-based access controls for dealership data systems with quarterly recertification, reducing unauthorized access to customer financial information by 50%.  
Metric: % reduction in unauthorized access attempts

The timestamp field for windowing is 'event\_timestamp'. For the 'user\_sessions' stream, after the window operation, add an aggregate operation. This aggregate should define three output fields: 'session\_start' using window\_start, 'user' using the 'user\_id' field directly (this implies grouping by user\_id in aggregation later if possible, or handling user\_id per window output), and 'page\_view\_count' using count\_distinct on the 'page\_url' field.

My goal is perhaps in the next 10-15 years, I'd like to hit the director level at my current institition.

The university has an employee degree program. I'm looking at either an executive MBA (top 15) or a masters in information science (not sure about info sci, but top 10 for computer science).

My university covers all the tuition, but I would be on the hook for taxes for tuition over the amount of $5,250 a year. The EMBA would end up costing me tens of thousands in tax liability.

I feel that at this point, the EMBA be more helpful for my career than my masters in info sci would be. It seems that a lot of folks at the director level at my current institution have an MBA, but not sure if they completed the program before or after reaching the director level.

Some that I can think of for writing inside the orchestrator.

Pros:

\- Easier to manage since everything is in one place.

\- Able to use the full features of the orchestrator.

\-  Variables, Connections and Credentials are easier to manage.

Cons:

\- Tightly coupled with the orchestrator. Migrating your code might be annoying if you want to use different orchestrator.

\- Testing your code is not really easy.

\- Can only use python.

For writing code outside the orchestrator, it is pretty much the opposite of the above.

1l2sbm1,How Do You Organize A PySpark/Databricks Project,"Hey all,

I've been learning Spark/PySpark recently and I'm curious about how production projects are typically structured and organized.

My background is in DBT, where each model (table/view) is defined in a SQL file, and DBT builds a DAG automatically using `ref()` calls. For example:

    -- modelB.sql
    SELECT colA FROM {{ ref('modelA') }}
    

This ensures `modelA` runs before `modelB`. DBT handles the dependency graph for you, parallelizes independent models for faster builds, and allows for targeted runs using tags. It also supports automated tests defined in YAML files, which run before the associated models.

I'm wondering how similar functionality is achieved in Databricks. Is lineage managed manually, or is there a framework to define dependencies and parallelism? How are tests defined and automatically executed? I'd also like to understand how this works in vanilla Spark without Databricks.

  
TLDR - How are Databricks or vanilla Spark projects organized in production. How are things like 100s of tables, lineage/DAGs, orchestration, and tests managed?

1l3a0yc,[Architecture Feedback Request] Taking external API → Azure Blob → Power BI Service,"Hei! I’m designing a solution to pull daily survey data from an external API and load it into Power BI Service in a secure and automated way. Here’s the main idea:

	•	Use an Azure Function to fetch paginated API data and store it in Azure Blob Storage (daily-partitioned .json files).

	•	Power BI connects to the Blob container, dynamically loads the latest file/folder, and refreshes on schedule.

	•	No API calls happen inside Power BI Service (to avoid dynamic data source limitations). I was trying to do normal built-in GET API from Power BI Service but it doesn't accept dynamic data sources (Power BI Desktop works well, no issues) as API usually does.

	•	Everything is designed with data protection and scalability in mind — future-compatible with Fabric Lakehouse.
P/S: The reason we are forced to go with this solution without using Fabric architecture because it requires cost-effective solution and Fabric integration is planning to be deployed in our organization (potentially project starts from November)

1l342li,"refactoring my DE code, looking for advice","I'm contracting for a small company as a data analyst, I've written python scripts that run inside docker container on an AZ VM daily to get and transform the data for PBI reporting, current setup:

* API 1:
   * Call 8 different endpoints.
   * some are incremental, some are overwritten daily
   * Have 40 different API keys (think of it like a different logic unit), all calling the same things.
   * they're storing the keys in their MySQL table (I think this is bad, but I have no power over this).
* API 2 and 3:
   * four different endpoints.
   * some are incremental, some are overwritten daily
* DuckDB to transform and throw files to blob storage for reporting.

the problem lies with API 1, it takes long since I'm calling one after another.

I could rewrite the scripts to be async, but might as well make it more scalable and clean, things I'm thinking about, all of them have their own learning curve:

* using docker swarm.
* setting up Airbyte on the VM, since the annoying api is there.
* Setting up Airflow on the VM.
* moving it to Azure container App jobs and removing the VM all together.
   * this saves a bit of money, but not a big deal at this scale.
   * this is way more scalable and cleanest.
   * googling around about container apps, I can't figure out if I can orchestrate it using Azure Data Factory.
   * can't figure out how to dynamically create the replicas for the 40 Keys
      * I can either just export template and have one job for each one and add new ones as needed (not often).

I've never set one up from scratch before and I don't really have anyone in my company/department knowledgeable enough to lean on. We use GitHub for source controlling, so Github Actions is my CI/CD method  
  
Currently, I've explored the following avenues: 

* Redgate Flyway  
   * It sounds nice for migration, but the concept of having to restructure our repo layout and having to have multiple versions of the same file just with the intended changes (assuming I'm understanding how its supposed to work) seems kind of cumbersome and we're kind of trying to get away from Redgate.
* DACPAC Deployment
   * I like the idea, I like the auto diffing and how it automatically knows to alter or create or drop or whatever but this seems to have a whole partial deployment thing in the event of it failing part way through that's hard to get around for me. Not only that, but it seems to diff what's in the DB compared to source control (which, ideally is what we want) but prod has a history of hotfixes (not a deal breaker) and also, the DB settings are default ANSI NULLS Enabled: False + Quoted Identifiers Enabled: False. Modifying this setting on the DB is apparently not an option which means Devs will have to enable it at the file level in the sqlproj.
* Bash
   * Writing a custom bash script that takes only the changes meant to be applied per PR and deploys them. This however, will require plenty of testing and maintenance and I'm terrified of allowing table renames and alterations because of dataloss. Procs and Views can probably be just dropped and re-created as a means of deployment, but not really a great option for Functions and UDTs because of possible dependencies and certainly not for tables. This also has partial deployment issues that I can't skirt with transaction wrapping the entire deploy...

For reference, I work for a company where NOLOCK is commonplace in queries so locking tables for pretty much any amount of time is a non-negotiable no. I'd want the ability to rollback deployments in the event of failure, but if I'm not able to use transactions, I'm not sure what options I have since I'm inexperienced in this avenue.

But my question is this - is there ANY training out there for the customer? Our biggest bottleneck with each new deployment is that the customer has no clue what to do or even understand the work they own. They need to provide the process. The scenarios. But what I've witnessed is we start the project. The customer sits back and says ""ask away"". How do you teach a customer the engagement needed on their side? The level of detail we will ultimately need? The importance of identifying ALL likely scenarios? How do we train them so they don't have to go through the mistakes or hypercare issues to fully grasp it? 

We waste so much time going in circles. And I even sometimes get attitude and questions like - why do you need to know that?

Looking for someone with a good experience in Informatica DEI/BDM. Currently I am trying to read binary data from Kafka topic that represents XML files.

I have created a mapping that is reading this topic, and enabled column projection on the data column while specifying the XSD schema for the file.

I then create the corresponding target on HDFS with same schema and mapped the columns.

The issue is that when running the mapping I am having a NullPointerException linked to a function called populateBooleans.

1l3x7vk,A disaster waiting to happen,"TLDR; My company wants to replace our pipelines with some all-in-one “AI agent” platform

I’m a lone data engineer in a mid-size retail/logistics company that runs SAP ERP (moving to HANA soon). Historically, every department pulled SAP data into Excel, calculated things manually, and got conflicting numbers. I was hired into a small analytics unit to centralize this. I’ve automated data pulls from SAP exports, APIs, scrapers, and built pipelines into SQL Server. It’s traceable, consistent, and used regularly.

Now, our new CEO wants to “centralize everything” and “go AI-driven” by bringing in a no-name platform that offers:

\- Limited source connectors for a basic data lake/warehouse setup

\- A simple SQL interface + visualization tools

\- And the worst of it all: an AI agent PER DEPARTMENT

Each department will have its own AI “instance” with manually provided business context. Example: “This is how finance defines tenure,” or “Sales counts revenue like this.” Then managers are supposed to just ask the AI for a metric, and it will generate SQL and return the result. Supposedly, this will replace 95–97% of reporting, instantly (and the CTO/CEO believe it).

Obviously, I’m extremely skeptical:

\- Even with perfect prompts and context, if the underlying data is inconsistent (e.g. rehire dates in free text, missing fields, label mismatches), the AI will silently get it wrong.

\- There’s no way to audit mistakes, so if a number looks off, it’s unclear who’s accountable. If a manager believes it, it may go unchallenged.

\- The answer to every flaw from them is: “the context was insufficient” or “you didn’t prompt it right.” That’s not sustainable or realistic

\- Also some people (probs including me) will have to manage and maintain all the departmental context logic, deal with messy results, and take the blame when AI gets it wrong.

\- Meanwhile, we already have a working, auditable, centralized system that could scale better with a real warehouse and a few more hires. They just don't want to hire a team or I have to convince them somehow (bc they think that this is a cheaper, more efficient alternative).

I’m still relatively new in this company and I feel like I’m not taken seriously, but I want to push back before we go too far, I'll switch jobs probably soon anyway but I'm actually concerned about my team.

1l3usad,Are Data Engineers Being Treated Like Developers in Your Org Too?,"Hey fellow data engineers 👋

Hope you're all doing well!

I recently transitioned into data engineering from a different field, and I’m enjoying the work overall — we use tools like Airflow, SQL, BigQuery, and Python, and spend a lot of time building pipelines, writing scripts, managing DAGs, etc.

But one thing I’ve noticed is that in cross-functional meetings or planning discussions, management or leads often refer to us as ""developers"" — like when estimating the time for a feature or pipeline delivery, they’ll say “it depends on the developers” (referring to our data team). Even other teams commonly call us ""devs.""

This has me wondering:

Is this just common industry language?

Or is it a sign that the data engineering role is being blended into general development work?

Do you also feel that your work is viewed more like backend/dev work than a specialized data role?


Just curious how others experience this. Would love to hear what your role looks like in practice and how your org views data engineering as a discipline.

Recently, a friend of mine mentioned an architecture that's been stuck in my head:

`Sources → Streaming → PostgreSQL (raw + incremental dbt modeling every few minutes) → Streaming → DW (BigQuery/Snowflake, read-only)`

Has anyone else seen or tried this approach?

It sounds appealing for cost reasons and clean separation of concerns, but I'm curious about practical trade-offs and real-world experiences.

1l4as6j,How to handle source table replication with duplicate records and no business keys in Medallion Architecture,"
Hi everyone,
I’m working as a data engineer on a project that follows a Medallion Architecture in Synapse, with bronze and silver layers on Spark, and the gold layer built using Serverless SQL.

For a specific task, the requirement is to replicate multiple source views exactly as they are — without applying transformations or modeling — directly from the source system into the gold layer. In this case, the silver layer is being skipped entirely, and the gold layer will serve as a 1:1 technical copy of the source views.

While working on the development, I noticed that some of these source views contain duplicate records. I recommended introducing logical business keys to ensure uniqueness and preserve data quality, even though we’re not implementing dimensional modeling. However, the team responsible for the source system insists that the views should be replicated as-is and that it’s unnecessary to define any keys at all.

I’m not convinced this is a good approach, especially for a layer that will be used for downstream reporting and analytics.

What would you do in this case?
Would you still enforce some form of business key validation in the gold layer, even when doing a simple pass-through replication?

\- I am the only person on the team capable of filtering an Excel table and reading/creating a pivot table,  and I only work very part-time on data management --> the platform must not bug often and must have a veryyyyy user-friendly interface (this takes PowerBI out of the equation)

\- We have about 6 different Excel files on the cloud to integrate, all together under a GB of data for now. Within a couple of years, it may pass this point.

\- Non-profit pricing or a free basic version is best!

\- The ability to display 'live' (from true live up to weekly refreshes) major data points on a public website is a huge plus.

\- I had an absolute nightmare of a time getting a Tableau Trial set up and the customer service was unable to fix a bug on the back end that prevented my email from setting up a demo, so they're out.",4,3,Tough_Vegetable_7737,2025-06-05 19:14:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l47vjb/best_dashboard_for_my_small_nonprofit/,1,False,False,False,False,2025-06-05 19:14:18,19,Thursday,181.0,978,58.76,6,250,12.7,0,0

1l40zmg,Taxonomies for most visited Web Sites?,"I am looking for existing website taxonomy / categorization data sources or at least some kind of closest approximation raw data for at least top 1000 most visited sites.

I suppose some of this data can be extracted from content filtering rules (e.g. office network ""allowlists"" / ""whitelists""), but I'm not sure what else can serve as a data source. Wikipedia? Querying LLMs? Parsing search engine results? SEO site rankings (e.g. so called ""top authority"")?

There is [`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_websites`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_websites), but it's very small.

The goal is to assemble a simple static website taxonomy for many different uses, e.g. automatic bookmark categorisation, category-based network traffic filtering, network statistics analysis per category, etc.

Examples for a desired category tree branches:

Surely I am not the only one trying to find a website categorisation solution? Am I missing some sort of an obvious data source?

1l49dv0,"How to handle repos with ETL pipelines for multiple clients that require use of PHI, PPI, or other sensitive data?","My company has a few clients and I am tasked with organizing our schemas so that each client has their own schema. I am mostly the only one working on ETL pipelines, but there are 1-2 devs who can split time between data and software, and our CTO who is mainly working on admin stuff but does help out with engineering from time to time. We deal with highly sensitive healthcare data. Our apps right now use mongo for our backend db, but a separate database for analytics. In the past we only required ETL pipelines for 2 clients, but as we are expanding analytics to our other clients we need to create ETL pipelines at scale. That also means making changes to our current dev process.

  
Right now both our production and preproduction data is stored in one single instance. Also, we only have one EC2 instance that houses our ETL pipeline for both clients AND our preproduction environment. My vision is to have two database instances (one for production data, one for preproduction data that can be used for testing both changes in the products and also our data pipelines) which are both HIPAA compliant. Also, to have two separate EC2 instances (and in the far future K8s); one for production ready code and one for preproduction code to test features, new data requests, etc.

  
My question is what is best practice: keep ALL ETL code for each client in one single repo and separate out in folders based on clients, or have separate repos, one for core ETL that loads parent tables and shared tables and then separate repos for each client? The latter seems like the safer bet, but just so much overhead if I'm the only one working on it. But I also want to build at scale seeing that we may be experiencing more growth than we imagine.

  
If it helps, right now our ETL pipelines are built in Python/SQL and scheduled via cron jobs. Currently exploring the use of dagster and dbt, but I do have some other client-facing analytics projects I gotta get done first.",2,4,JTags8,2025-06-05 20:15:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l49dv0/how_to_handle_repos_with_etl_pipelines_for/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-06-05 20:15:27,20,Thursday,353.0,1973,64.54,15,490,10.7,0,0

 **Key Questions:**
 1. **When to trigger?** Wait for consumer lag = 0? Use message count coordination? Poison pill?
 2. **During analysis:** Halt consumer or keep consuming new messages?
 
 **Options I'm considering:**
 - **Producer coordination:** Send expected message count, trigger when processed count matches for a product
 - **Lag-based:** Trigger when lag = 0 + timeout fallback  
 - **Continue consuming:** Analysis works on snapshot while new messages process

1l3lm9s,Building a Dataset of Pre-Race Horse Jog Videos with Vet Diagnoses — Where Else Could This Be Valuable?,"I’m a Thoroughbred trainer with 20+ years of experience, and I’m working on a project to capture a rare kind of dataset: video footage of horses jogging for the state vet before races, **paired with the official veterinary soundness diagnosis**.

Every horse jogs before racing — but that movement and judgment is never recorded or preserved. My plan is to:

* 📹 Record pre-race jogs using consistent camera angles
* 🩺 Pair each video with the licensed vet’s official diagnosis
* 📁 Store everything in a clean, machine-readable format

This would result in one of the **first real-world labeled datasets** of equine gait under live, regulatory conditions — not lab setups.

I’m planning to submit this as a proposal to the HBPA (horsemen’s association) and eventually get recording approval at the track. I’m not building AI myself — just aiming to structure, collect, and store the data for future use.

💬 **Question for the community:**  
Aside from AI lameness detection and veterinary research, where else do you see a market or need for this kind of dataset?
