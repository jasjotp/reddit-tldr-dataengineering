1kcsidy,Best Practice for Storing Raw Data: Use Correct Data Types or Store Everything as VARCHAR?,"My team is standardizing our raw data loading process, and we’re split on best practices.

I believe raw data should be stored using the correct data types (e.g., INT, DATE, BOOLEAN) to enforce consistency early and avoid silent data quality issues.
My teammate prefers storing everything as strings (VARCHAR) and validating types downstream — rejecting or logging bad records instead of letting the load fail.

We’re curious how other teams handle this:
	•	Do you enforce types during ingestion?
	•	Do you prefer flexibility over early validation?
	•	What’s worked best in production?

We’re mostly working with structured data in Oracle at the moment and exploring cloud options. ",51,32,mhpoon,2025-05-02 04:32:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1kcsidy/best_practice_for_storing_raw_data_use_correct/,0,False,False,False,False

1kct5lz,Laid-off Data Engineer Struggling to Transition – Need Career Advice,"
Hi everyone,

I’m based in the U.S. and have around 8 years of experience as a data engineer, primarily working with legacy ETL tools like Ab Initio and Informatica. I was laid off last year, and since then, I’ve been struggling to find roles that still value those tools.

Realizing the market has moved on, I took time to upskill myself – I’ve been learning Python, Apache Spark, and have also brushed up on advanced SQL. I’ve completed several online courses and done some hands-on practice, but when it comes to actual job interviews (especially those first calls with hiring managers), I’m not making it through.

This has really shaken my confidence. I’m beginning to worry: did I wait too long to make the shift? Is my career in data engineering over?

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has advice on how to bridge this gap, especially when transitioning from legacy tech to modern stacks, I’d really appreciate your thoughts.

Thanks in advance!

1kcmtda,How I do analytics on an OLTP database,"I work for a small company so we decided to use Postgres as our DWH. It's easy, cheap and works well for our needs. 

Where it falls short is if we need to do any sort of analytical work. As soon as the queries get complex, the time to complete skyrockets. 

I started using duckDB and that helped tremendously. The only issue was the scaffolding every time just so I could do some querying was tedious and the overall experience is pretty terrible when you compare writing SQL in a notebook or script vs an editor.

I liked the duckDB UI but the non-persistent nature causes a lot of headache. This led me to build [soarSQL](https://soarsql.com/) which is a duckDB powered SQL editor. 

soarSQL has quickly become my default SQL editor at work because it makes working with OLTP databases a breeze. On top of this, I get save a some money each month because I the bulk of the processing happens on my machine locally!

1kd6u3s,"How much is your org spending on ETL SaaS, and how hard would it be to internalize it?","My current org builds all ETL in-house. The AWS bill for is a few hundred USD a month (more context on this number at the end), and it's a lot cheaper to hire more engineers in our emerging market than it is to foot 4 or 5 digit monthly payments in USD. Are any of you in the opposite situation? 

For some data sources that we deal with, afaik there isn't any product available that would even do what's needed, e.g. send a GET request to endpoint E with payload P if conditions C1 or C2 or ... or Cn are met, schedule that with cronjob T, and then write the response to the DW. Which I imagine is a very normal situation.

I keep seeing huge deals in the ETL space (fivetran just acquired census btw), and I wonder who's making the procurement decisions that culminate in the tens of thousands of six or seven digit monthly ETL bills that justify these valuations.

Context: Our DW grows at about 2-3 GB/ month, and we have ~120GB in total.

1kd34is,Data infrastructure for self-driving labs,"Hello folks, I recently joined a research center with a mission to manage data generated from our many labs. This is my first time building data infrastructure, I'm eager to learn from you in the industry.

We deal with a variety of data. Time-series from sensor data log, graph data from knowledge graph, and vector data from literature embedding. We also have relational data coming from characterization. Right now, each lab manages their own data, they are all saved as Excel for csv files in disperse places.

From initial discussion, we think that we should do the following:

A. Find databases to house the lab operational data.

B. Implement a data lake to centralize all the data from different labs

C. Turn all relational data to documents (JSON), as schema might evolve and we don't really do heave analytics or reporting, AI/ML modelling is more of the focus.

If you have any comments on the above points, they will be much appreciated.

I also have a question in mind:

1. For databases, is it better to find specific database for each type of data (neo4j for graph, Chroma for vector...etc), or we would be better of with a general purpose database (e.g. Cassandra) that houses all types of data to simplify managing processes but to lose specific computing capacity for each data type(for example, Cassandra can't do graph traversal)?
2. Cloud infrastructure seems to be the trend, but we have our own data center so we need to leverage it. Is it possible to use the managed solution from Cloud provides (Azure, AWS, we don't have a preference yet) and still work with our own storage and compute on-prem?

Open data publishing shouldn’t be hard. We want local governments, academics, and NGOs to treat publishing their data like any other SaaS subscription: sign up, upload, update, and go.

- Existing platforms are either extremely expensive or require a technical team to set up and maintain.
- Scaling an open data portal usually means dedicating an entire engineering department—and we believe that shouldn’t be the case.

1kd422z,Replace a web app with dataiku - advice?,"Hello everyone,

I work as a Data Engineer in a team where we have set up a fairly standard but robust processing chain:
	• We have “raw” tables in BigQuery
	• We make transformations to move from the fine mesh (transaction) to the aggregate mesh.
	• Then we export a copy of this data into PostgreSQL
	• The backend relies on these tables to power a web application allowing businesses to make dynamic multi-mesh aggregations

And there… we are being told that we are going to replace this web application with Dataiku.
The idea is to keep the processing in BigQuery, but for business users to do their exploration directly via Dataiku instead of going through the app.

I am divided:
	• I understand that Dataiku can give more autonomy to professions
	• But I find that it is not designed for dynamic or multi-mesh visualization
	• And that seems a little rigid to me compared to a web front which offered more control, more logic, and a real UX

1.  We frequently update conversion and click data. Hence, we keep updating aggregated data as well.

2. New column addition is frequent( once a month). Currently, this requires changes in lots of Hive QL and SQL procedures
