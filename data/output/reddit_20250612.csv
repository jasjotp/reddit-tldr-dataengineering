1l9b4rg,Too risky to quit current job?,"I graduated last August with a bachelors degree in Math from a good university. The job market already sucked then and it sucked even more considering I only had one internship and it was not related to my field. I ended up getting a job as a data analyst through networking, but it was a basically an extended internship and I now work in the IT department doing basic IT things and some data engineering.

My company wants me to move to another state and I have already done some work there for the past 3 months but I do not want to continue working in IT. I can also tell that the company I work for is going to shit at least in regards to the IT department given how many experienced people we have lost in the past year.

After thinking about it, I would rather be a full time ETL developer or data engineer. I actually have a part time gig as a data engineer for a startup but it is not enough to cover the bills right now.

**My question is how dumb would it be for me to quit my current job and work on getting certifications (I found some stuff on coursera but I am open to other ideas) to learn things like databricks, T-SQL, SSIS, SSRS, etc?** I have about one year of experience under my belt as a data analyst for a small company but I only really used Cognos Analytics, Python, and Excel.

I have about 6 months of expenses saved up where I could not work at all but with my part time gig and maybe some other low wage job I could make it last like a year and a half.

EDIT: I did not make it clear but I currently have a side job as a microsoft fabric data engineer and while the program has bad reviews on reddit, I am still learning Power BI, Azure, PySpark, Databricks, and some other stuff. It actually has covered my expenses for the past three months (if I did not have my full time job) but it might not be consistent. I am mostly wondering if quitting my current job which is basically as an IT helpdesk technician and still doing this side job while also getting certifications from Microsoft, Tableau, etc would allow me to get some kind of legit data engineering job in the near future.

We deal with food article data where the data is being manually managed by users and enriched with additional information for exmaple information about the products content size etc. 

We developed ETL pipelines to do some other business logic on that however there seem to be many cases where the data that gets to us is has some fields for example that are off by a factor of 1000 which is probably due to wrong user input. 

The consequences of that arent that dramatic but in many cases led to strange spikes in some metrics that are dependant of these values. When viewed via some dashboards in tableau for example, the customer questions whether our data is right and why the amount of expenses in this or that month are so high etc. 

How do you deal with cases like that? I mean if there are obvious value differences with a factor of 1000 I could come up with some solutions to just correct that but how do I keep the data clean of other errors?",8,5,Comfortable_Onion318,2025-06-12 10:51:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l9jfam/how_do_you_deal_with_user_inputs/,0,False,False,False,False
1l9i4dl,Turning on CDC in SQL Server ‚Äì What kind of performance degradation should I expect?,"Hey everyone,  
I'm looking for some real-world input from folks who have enabled Change Data Capture (CDC) on SQL Server in production environments.

We're exploring CDC to stream changes from specific tables into a Kafka pipeline using Debezium. Our approach is *not* to turn it on across the entire database‚Äîonly on a small set of high-value tables.

However, I‚Äôm running into some organizational pushback. There‚Äôs a general concern about performance degradation, but so far it‚Äôs been more of a blanket objection than a discussion grounded in specific metrics or observed issues.

If you've enabled CDC on SQL Server:

* What kind of performance overhead did you notice, if any?
* Was it CPU, disk I/O, log growth, query latency‚Äîor all of the above?
* Did the overhead vary significantly based on table size, write frequency, or number of columns?
* Any best practices you followed to minimize the impact?

1l9q0dr,Need Feedback Before Submitting My Data Engineer Test Assignment üöÄ,"Hi all üëã



I‚Äôm working on a take-home assignment for a full-time Data Engineer role and want to sanity-check my approach before submitting.



The task:



\-Build a data ingestion pipeline using Golang + RabbitMQ + MySQL



\-Use proper Go project structure (golang-standards/project-layout)



\-Publish 3 messages into RabbitMQ (goroutine)



\-Consume messages and write into MySQL (payment\_events)



\-On primary key conflict, insert into skipped\_messages table



\-Dockerize with docker-compose



What I‚Äôve built:



‚úÖ Modular Go project (cmd/, internal/, config/, etc.)

‚úÖ Dockerized stack: MySQL, RabbitMQ, app containers with healthchecks

‚úÖ Config via .env (godotenv)

‚úÖ Publisher: Sends 3 payloads via goroutine

‚úÖ Consumer: Reads from RabbitMQ ‚Üí inserts into MySQL

‚úÖ Duplicate handling: catches MySQL Error 1062 ‚Üí redirects to skipped\_messages

‚úÖ Safe handling of multiple duplicate retries (no crashes)

‚úÖ Connection retry logic (RabbitMQ, MySQL)

‚úÖ Graceful shutdown handling

‚úÖ /health endpoint for liveness

‚úÖ Unit tests for publisher/consumer

‚úÖ Fully documented test plan covering all scenarios



Where I need input:



While this covers everything in the task, I‚Äôm wondering:



\-Is this level enough for real-world interviews?



\-Are they implicitly expecting more? (e.g. DLQs, better observability, structured logging, metrics, operational touches)



\-Would adding more ""engineering maturity"" signals strengthen my submission?

1l9pvpg,How to synchronize data from a RDS Aurora Postgres Database to a self-hosted Analytics database (Timescale) in near real-time?,"Hi,

Our main OLTP database is an RDS Aurora Postgres database and it's working well but we need to perform some analytics queries that we currently do on a read replica but some of those queries are quite slow and we want to offload all of this to an OLAP or OLAP-like database. Most of our data is similar to a time-series so we thought of going with another Postgres instance but with Timescale installed to create aggregate functions. We mainly need to keep sums / averages / of historical data and timescale seems like a good fit for this.

The problem I have is how can I keep RDS -> Postgres in sync? Our use-case cannot really have batched data because our services need this analytics data to perform domain decisions (has a user reached his daily transactions limit for example) and we also want to offload all of our grafana dashboards from the main database to Timescale.

What do people usually use for this? Debezium? Logical Replication? Any other tool?

We would really like to keep using RDS as a source of truth but offload all analytics to another DB that is more suited for this, if possible.

If so, how do you deal with an evolving DDL schema over time, do you just apply your DB migrations to both DBs and call it a day? Do you keep a completely different schema for the second database?

Our Timescale instance would be hosted in K8s through the CNPG operator.

I want to add that we are not 100% set on Timescale and would be open to other suggestions. We also looked at Starrocks, a CNCF project, which looks promising but a bit complex to get up and running.",1,4,eMperror_,2025-06-12 15:49:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1l9pvpg/how_to_synchronize_data_from_a_rds_aurora/,1,False,False,False,False
