1jpknlr,Is Databricks Becoming a Requirement for Data Engineers?,"Hey everyone,

I’m a Data Engineer with 5 years of experience, mostly working with traditional data pipelines, cloud data warehouses(AWS and Azure) and tools like Airflow, Kafka, and Spark. However, I’ve never used Databricks in a professional setting.

Lately, I see Databricks appearing more and more in job postings, and it seems like it's becoming a key player in the data world. For those of you working with Databricks, do you think it's a necessity for Data Engineers now? I see that it is mandatory requirement in job offerings but I don't have opportunity to get first experience in it.

What is your opinion, what should I do?",84,41,BigDataMax,2025-04-02 09:41:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jpknlr/is_databricks_becoming_a_requirement_for_data/,0,False,False,False,False
1jpkgey,Does anyone feel the DE tools are chaging too fast to track,"TL;DR: a guy feeling stuck in the job and cannot figure out what skills are needed to move to a better position 

I am data engineer at a big 4 firm (may be just a etl developer) in india.

I work with Informatica Power Center, Oracle, Unix on the daily basis. Now, when I tried to switch companies for career boost, I realised nobody uses these tech anymore. 

Everyone uses pyspark for etl.
I though fair enough and started leaning pyspark dataframe api. I am so good with sql, pl/sql and python, so it was easy for me.

Then I came to know learning pyspark is not enough, you need to know databricks, snowflake, dbt kind of tools.

Even before making my mind to decide what to learn, things changed and now airflow/dagster, redshift, delta lake, duckdb. I don't what else is in trend now.

Honestly, It feels a lot, like the world is moving in the fastest pace possible and I cannot even decide what to do.

Every job has different tools, and to do the ""fake it till you make it"", I am afraid they would ask any niche question about the tool to which you can only answer if you have the experience.

My profile  is not even getting picked and I feel stuck in the job I am doing.

I am great at what I do, that is one reason the project is not letting me leave even after all the senior folks has left for better projects. The guy with 3 years of experience is the senior most developer and lead now.

But honestly, I dont think I can make it anymore.

If I was just stuck with something like SAP ABAP, frontend or core python, things might have been good. Recruiters will at least look at your profile even though you are not a perfect match as you can learn the rest to do the job. (I might be wrong in this thought)

But for DE roles, the job descriptions are becoming too specific to a tool and people are expecting complete data architect level of skills at 3 years.

I was so ambitious to get a job in a different country with big 4 experience, but now I can't even get a job in india.",42,32,venkatcg,2025-04-02 09:26:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jpkgey/does_anyone_feel_the_de_tools_are_chaging_too/,0,False,2025-04-02 09:30:54,False,False

1jpxfch,"New to Data Engineering — Feeling a Bit Overwhelmed, Looking for Advice","Hey everyone, I could really use some advice from fellow engineers. I'm pretty new to the data world — I messed up uni, then did an online analytics course, and after about a year and a half of grinding, I finally landed my first role. Along the way, I found a real passion for Python and SQL.

My first job involved a ton of patchy reporting because of messy infra and data. I started automating painful tasks using basic ETL pipelines I built myself. I showed an interest in APIs and, out of nowhere, 6 months in, I was offered a data engineering role.

Fast forward to now — I’ve been in the new role for a month, and I’m the company’s only data engineer. I’m doing a data engineering apprenticeship at the same time, which helps, but the imposter syndrome is real. The company’s been limping along with a 25-year-old piece of software that populates our SQL Server DB, and we’re now migrating to something new. I’ve been asked to learn MuleSoft for ETL and replace some existing pipelines that were built in Python.

I love the subject — I’m genuinely passionate about programming and networking — and I’m keen to take on new tech, improve the infra, and build up strong skills. But I’m not sure if I’m going too deep too fast. For example, today I was learning Docker to deploy Python scripts, just to avoid issues with hundreds of brittle batch files that break if we update Python.

My boss seems to think MuleSoft will fully replace Python, but I see it more as a tool that complements certain workflows rather than a full replacement. What worries me more is that I don’t really have any technical peers. Most people in my team only know basic SQL, and it’s hard to communicate strategy or get proper feedback.

My current priorities are getting comfortable with MuleSoft, Git, and Docker. I’m constantly learning, but sometimes I leave work feeling overwhelmed. There’s so much broken or duct-taped together, I don’t even know where to start. I keep telling myself I don’t need to “save the world,” but I really want to do a good job and come away with solid experience.

Long term, they want to deploy this new software, rebuild the database, and eventually use AI to help employees query the business. There’s a shit ton to do, and I’m still figuring out basics — like setting up a VM just so I can run Docker.

Am I jumping the gun with how I’m feeling, or is this as wild a situation as it seems? Any advice for a new engineer navigating bad infra, limited support, and a mountain of work would be seriously appreciated.",8,3,ethg674,2025-04-02 19:27:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jpxfch/new_to_data_engineering_feeling_a_bit_overwhelmed/,0,False,False,False,False

1jplvx0,Suggestions for workflow automation,"Hey there :)

  
I hope I find myself in the right subreddit for this as I am trying to **engineer** my computer to push around some **data** ;) 

I'm currently working on a project to fully automate the processing of test results for a scientific study with students. 

The workflow consists of several stages:

1. **Data Extraction:** The test data is extracted from a local SQL database.
2. **SPSS Processing:** The extracted data is then processed using SPSS with a custom-built syntax (legacy). This step generates multiple files from the data. I have been looking into how I can transition this syntax to a python script, so this step might be cut later.
3. **Python Automation:** A Python script takes over the further processing. It reads the files, splits the data per class, inserts it into pre-designed Excel reporting templates.
4. **File Upload:** The files are then automatically uploaded to a self-hosted Nextcloud instance.
5. **Notification:** Once the workflow is complete, a notification  

I have been thinking about different ways to implement this. Right now the inputs and outputs for the different steps are still done manually. 

At work I have been using Jenkins lately and I think it feels natural  to do it in Jenkins and just describe the whole workflow in a pipeline with different stages to run. Besides that I have some experience with AWS Lambda and n8n but I am not sure if they would be helpful with this task.

I´m not that experienced setting up such workflows as my work background is more in Infosec, so please forgive my uneducated guesses about how I best go about this :D Just trying not to take decisions that will be problematic later.

1jpdpyh,Facebook Marketing API - Anyone have a successful ETL experience?,"We have a python integration set up where we pull data from Google Ads and Facebook Marketing into our data warehouse. We're pulling data about all 3 hierarchy tiers and some daily metrics:

1. Campaigns (id, name, start time, stop time)
2. Ad Groups/Ad Sets (id, name)
3. Ads (id, name, URL)
4. Metrics (clicks, impressions, spend) for the previous day

For the Google Ads API, you basically send a SQL query and the return time is like a tenth of a second.

For Facebook, we see returns times in the minutes, especially on the Ads piece. Was hoping to get an idea of how others might have successfully set up a process to get this data from Facebook in a more timely fashion, and possibly without hitting the rate limiting threshold.

Not the exact code we're using - I can get it off my work system tomorrow - but the gist:

    from facebook_business.adobjects.adaccount import AdAccount
    from facebook_business.adobjects.campaign import Campaign
    from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import AdSet
    from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import Ad
    from facebook_business.adobjects.adcreative import AdCreative
    campaigns = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_campaigns(
        params={},
        fields=[Campaign.Field.id,Campaign.Field.name,Campaign.Field.start_time,Campaign.Field.stop_time]
    )
    adsets= AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_sets(
        params={},
        fields=[AdSet.Field.id,AdSet.Field.name]
    )
    ads = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ads(
        params={},
        fields=[Ad.Field.id,Ad.Field.name,Ad.Field.creative]
    )
    object_urls = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_creatives(
        params={},
        fields=[AdCreative.Field.object_story_spec]

        params={},
        fields=[AdCreative.Field.asset_feed_spec]
    )

We then have to do some joining between ads/object\_urls/asset\_urls to match the Ad with the destination URL if the ad is clicked on.

The performance is so slow, that I hope we are doing it wrong. I was never able to get the batch call to work and I'm not sure how to improve things.

1jpn1do,Help a noob understand whether this is feasible,"Hey all,
I’m working on a project that involves building a comprehensive overview of all therapist-related businesses in my country. I’ve found a public online source that lists approximately 16,000 such businesses, spread across many paginated result pages.

Each entry links to a detail page with information such as:

Business name
Business owner (person or legal entity)
Registration number (similar to a company ID)
Location (optional)
No consistent link to a website, but it's often listed in the details

What I need help with:

(1) Scrape all business data into a structured list (CSV, JSON or database).
This involves crawling through all paginated pages and collecting each business profile’s content.

(2) Automatically search for a homepage/website for each business.
The source doesn't always list websites, so for those missing, I'd like to auto-search Google (or use a business API if necessary) to find the most likely company homepage.
(3) If a homepage is found: scrape relevant data from the website itself.

Goal:
To build a clean, filterable dataset that can be used for matching clients with therapists (via a separate platform I'm developing).

Questions I’d like help with:

Is this technically feasible using open tools or affordable APIs? What/who exactly would I be looking for? I have tried navigating Fiverr, but I am simply not sure what I need to be frank...

1jpmgvn,Feedback on Terraform Data Stack Starter,"Hi, everyone!

I'm a solo data consultant and over the past few years, I’ve been helping companies in Europe build their data stacks.

I noticed I was repeatedly performing the same tasks across my projects: setting up dbt, configuring Snowflake, and, more recently, migrating to Iceberg data lakes.

So I've been working on a solution for the past few months called [**Boring Data**](http://boringdata.io).

It's a set of Terraform templates ready to be deployed in AWS and/or Snowflake with pre-built integrations for ELT tools and orchestrators.

I think these templates are a great fit for many projects:

* Pay once, own it forever
* Get started fast
* Full control

I'd love to get feedback on this approach, which isn't very common (from what I've seen) in the data industry.

Is Terraform commonly used on your teams, or is that a barrier to using templates like these?

Is there a starter template that you'd wished you had for an implementation in the past?",1,3,Economy-Spread1955,2025-04-02 11:40:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jpmgvn/feedback_on_terraform_data_stack_starter/,0,False,False,False,False
1jpm06j,Help with a data engineering project,"Hello guys, me and teammates want to do a project from a-z to practice what we learned in an internship we are in and we wanted to the project to be about a telecom company’s data and we have searched a lot for a dataset that mimics the datasets of real telecom companies but we never found what we are looking for so we thought about creating the data we want using AI but for some reason it’s also not working out for us so i would love to hear some suggestions about what we should do and about telecom data warehouses and databases because i feel maybe we just don’t still quite understand how telecom companies generally operate and perhaps that’s why we are not successful in generating the data.

I hope this post makes sense because i’m just very confused and don’t know what to do for this project.

1jpk2oe,[BIGQUERY] How long does it take for a backfill and for the buffer resulting from that to clear?,"Hey all, 

1. I have two tables which are about 20-30 gbs and I created a backfill for them as I noticed that two days data was missing, now after an hour the backfill completed, now I am seeing some items in the streaming buffer, I need to update my seniors when the data is ready for analysis, so when can I safely say the data is present?

2. Also, one more question, if I insert a row manually into Bigquery and then create a backfill for it to fetch the data again from transactional database, will the entry I added manually (which doesn't exist in transactional database) be erased?

3. Is there a way to track the ingestion of data into BigQuery?

1jpjdes,Beginner using API (AWS),"Hi. I work for the state and some of the tools we have are limited. Each week I go to AWS QuickSight to download a CSV file back to our NAS drive where it feeds my Power BI dashboard. I have a gateway setup for cloud to talk to my on-premise NAS drive so auto refresh works. 

Now, my next task: I want to automate the AWS data directly from Power BI so I don’t have to log into their website each week but how do I accomplish this without a programming background? (I majored in Asian History so I don’t know much about data engineering/setting up pipelines)

I read some articles and it seems to indicate that using API can accomplish this but I don’t know Python/SDKs nor do I use CLI (I did some Powershell) and even if I do what services should I use to run CLI for me behind the scenes? Can Power BI make API calls and handle JSON?

1jpj0a0,Is my career choice taking me away from Data engineering jobs ?,"Hello everyone,

First of all English is not my first language so I apologize if there are mistakes or if everything is not clear.

I've been working for 6 years and my career path is not very consistent.  
I started in non-technical positions for 3 years and then moved on to a more technical one. 

For 3 years I had a very diversified job with software development (Php, Python), database management, Linux system administration, a bit of Cloud and a big part of “Data” with ETL flows (Talend) and a lot of SQL. The project was quite large and the team very small, so I was working on several tasks at once.

I really enjoyed the Data part and I got it into my head that I wanted to be a 'real' Data Engineer and not just drag and drop on Talend.

I was just starting my research when a friend of mine contacted me because a software engineer position was opening up in his company. I went through the recruitment process and accepted their proposal.

  
As in my previous position, I'll be working on a lot of things (mobile development, backend, a bit of frontend, cloud, devops) and the salary offered was 20% higher than what I had in my previous job. (I'm now at 48k€ and I don't live in a big city).  
The offer was really attractive and as the market is a bit complicated at the moment, I accepted.

But I'm wondering if this choice will take me even further away from the Data Engineer job i wanted.

Do you find my career path coherent?  
Could I switch back to Data in a few years' time?

1jpqnx3,I Want To Improve an Internal Process At My Company,"Hey r/dataengineering,

I'm currently transitioning from a software engineering role to data engineering, and I've identified a potential project at my company that I think would be a great learning experience and a chance to introduce some data engineering best practices.

Project Overview:

We have a dashboard that displays employee utilization data, sourced from two main systems: Harvest (time tracking) and Forecast (projected utilization).

Current Process:

* Harvest Data: Currently, we're using cron jobs running on an EC2 instance to periodically pull data from Harvest.
* Forecast Data: Due to the lack of an API, we're relying on Playwright (web scraping) to extract data from their web reports, which are then saved to S3.
* Data Processing: Another cron job on EC2 processes the S3 reports and loads the data into a PostgreSQL database.
* Dashboard: A custom frontend application (using Azure OAuth) queries the PostgreSQL database to display the utilization data.

Proposed Solution:

I'm proposing a serverless architecture on AWS, using the following components:

* API Gateway + Lambda: To create a robust API for our frontend application.
* Lambda for ETL: To automate data extraction, transformation, and loading from Harvest and Forecast.
* AWS Step Functions: To orchestrate the data pipeline and manage dependencies.
* Amazon RDS PostgreSQL: To serve as our data warehouse for analytical queries.
* API Gateway Authorizer: To integrate Azure OAuth authentication.
* CI/CD with CodePipeline and CodeBuild: To automate testing and deployment.
* Docker and SAM CLI: For local development and testing.

My Goals:

* Gain hands-on experience with AWS serverless technologies.
* Implement data engineering best practices for ETL and data warehousing.
* Improve the reliability and scalability of our data pipeline.
* Potentially expand this architecture to serve as a central data warehouse for other company analytical data.

My Questions:

1. For those with experience in similar projects, what are some key considerations or potential challenges I should be aware of?
2. Any advice on best practices for designing and implementing a serverless data pipeline on AWS?
3. Are there any specific AWS services or tools that you would recommend for this project?
4. How would you recommend getting started on a project like this, what would you focus on first?
5. What would be some good ways to test this type of system?

I'm eager to learn and contribute, and I appreciate any insights or advice you can offer.

1jpo030,"How would you solve a low-tech, distributed attendance tracking and service impact problem for a nonprofit with no digital infrastructure?","I’m working with a nonprofit, supporting 17 veteran communities. The communities aren’t brick-and-mortar — they meet at churches and community spaces, and track attendance manually. There’s very little technology — no computers, mostly just phones and Facebook.

They want to understand:
	•	What services are being offered at the community level
	•	Who’s attending (recurring vs new)
	•	No-show rates
	•	Cost per veteran for services

The challenge: no digital systems or staff capacity for manual data entry.

What tech-light solutions or data collection flows would you recommend to gather this info and make it analyzable?

1jpz36k,How AI will dramatically change DE,"After some struggle with a pipeline today, Gemini 2.5 one-shotted the solution. It's superior in most software problems compared to humans (check coders eval) and we're just two and a half years in.

The capabilities are mind-bending. Data engineering as we know it will change drastically with new AI tooling and self-adjusting infrastructure.

We know this profession will evolve drastically. What do you think where things are heading and how to hedge against AI? Become more social / human I guess 😂

A few hypotheses:
- pipelines and infra manages itself with much higher accuracy and less misconfigurations
- the data engineer profile will shift, they become subject matter experts, they must understand the business and do product management
- technical skills do not matter since the gap from idiot to genius is much smaller than from genius to agi/asi",0,8,Ok-Sentence-8542,2025-04-02 20:34:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jpz36k/how_ai_will_dramatically_change_de/,0,False,False,False,False
