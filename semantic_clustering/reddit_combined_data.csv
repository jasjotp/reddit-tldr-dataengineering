**The goal of SQLFlow is to bring the simplicity of DuckDB to streaming data.**

SQLFlow is a high-performance stream processing engine that simplifies building data pipelines by enabling you to define them using just SQL. Think of SQLFLow as a lightweight, modern Flink.

SQLFlow models stream-processing as SQL queries using the [DuckDB SQL dialect](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/introduction.html). Express your entire stream processing pipeline—ingestion, transformation, and enrichment—as a single SQL statement and configuration file.

Process [10's of thousands of events per second](https://sql-flow.com/docs/tutorials/clickhouse-sink) on a single machine with low memory overhead, using Python, DuckDB, Arrow and Confluent Python Client.

Tap into the DuckDB ecosystem of tools and libraries to build your stream processing applications. SQLFlow supports [parquet](https://sql-flow.com/docs/tutorials/s3-parquet-sink), csv, json and [iceberg](https://sql-flow.com/docs/tutorials/iceberg-sink).

The app currently shows the transaction log-based and query-based CDC approaches.

Change Data Capture (CDC) is a design pattern that tracks changes (inserts, updates, deletes) in a database and makes those changes available to downstream systems in real-time or near real-time.

CDC is super useful for a variety of use cases:

\- Real-time data replication between operational databases and data warehouses or lakehouses

\- Keeping analytics systems up to date without full batch reloads

\- Synchronizing data across microservices or distributed systems

\- Feeding event-driven architectures by turning database changes into event streams

\- Maintaining materialized views or derived tables with fresh data

\- Simplifying ETL/ELT pipelines by processing only changed records

And many more!

I am reviewing for interviews and the following question come to mind.

If **surrogate keys** are supposed to be unique identifiers that don't have real world meaning AND if **primary keys** are supposed to reliably identify and distinguish between each individual record (which also don't have real world meaning), then why will someone use a surrogate key? Wouldn't using primary keys be the same? Is there any case in which surrogate keys are the way to go?

P.S: Both surrogate and primary keys are auto generated by DB. Right?

P.S.1: I understand that a surrogate key doesn't necessarily have to be the a primary key, so considering that both have no real meaning outside the DB, then I wonder what the purpose of surrogate keys are.

P.S.2: At work (in different projects), we mainly use natural keys for analytical workloads and primary keys for uniquely identifying a given row. So I am wondering on which kind of cases/projects these surrogate keys will fit.

https://reddit.com/link/1jnh7pu/video/wcl9lru6zure1/player

You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/Fszta/dbt-column-lineage), and the package on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/dbt-col-lineage/0.1.1/)

8,1jni0xm,Transitioning from DE to ML Engineer in 2025?,"I am a DE with 2 years of experience, but my background is mainly in statistics. I have been offered a position as an ML Engineer (de facto Data Scientist, but also working on deployment - it is a smaller IT department, so my scope of duties will be simply quite wide). 

The position is interesting, and there are multiple pros and cons to it (that I do not want to discuss in this post). However my question is a bit more general - in 2025, with all the LLMs performing quite well with code generation and fixing, which path would you say is more stable long-term - sticking to DE and becoming better and better at it, or moving more towards ML and doing data science projects?

Furthermore, I also wonder about growth in each field - in ML/DS, my fear is that I am not PhD nor excellent mathematician. In DE, on the other hand, my fear is lack of my solid CS/SWE foundations (as my background is more in statistics). 

Ultimately, it is just an honest question, as I am very curious of your perspective on the matter - does moving towards data science projects (XGBoost and other algorithms) in 2025 from DE (PySpark and Airflow) makes sense in 2025? Which path would you say is more reasonable, and what kind of growth I can expect for each position?

13,1jndfr9,Building a Cloud-Based Data Pipeline for Personal Use/Learning/Projects,"I am a data/functional analyst looking to get a better grasp on 'end-to-end data management and processing' (in quotations as that's the term my direct lead used when we aligned regarding my career objectives for the year, which definitely matches with my current interests).

Given this objective, my own interest in gaining a better grasp on general principles and functions of Data Engineering (and later on, Data Science), as well as a personal project I'm looking to finish for myself/my own portfolio by the end of the year, I'm looking for a cloud-based data pipeline solution for me to spend my role's training stipend on -- though I'm willing (and allowed) to use some of my personal funds on this as well since it's both for career progression and personal fun.

I started looking for small-scale subscriptions for some of the platforms we've previously used at work (AWS, Databricks), but the consensus I've gotten is that cost-wise, I'm potentially better off with multiple smaller platforms that I can just weave together, instead of going for platforms normally designed for enterprise use. And so I come here for help!

*(Though if this is not the right community for me to ask this, please let me know where instead)*

# Budget and Scope

* Base budget is a $200 stipend from our department, which refreshes at the end of the year
* I'm willing to add another $200-300/year, if necessary
* I'm from South-East Asia (converting our local currency, in case regional pricing matters)
* I prefer platforms/solutions that come with upfront costs instead of per-pull/use costs, so that's it's easier to manage the finances involved
* Languages I'm comfortable with are Python and SQL, since these are what I mainly use for work, but willing to learn basics of new languages where necessary 
* Since I will be using my personal computer, which is not that powerful currently, I am looking for a pipeline/platform that I can use completely via cloud (including running training models) 

# Learning Objectives 

*(aka things I want my platform/s to be able to do)*

**1. Data Gathering/Ingestion/Validation/Transformation/Storage**

* Obviously not too familiar with this step currently, so I ended up lumping a bunch of them together, but essentially ETL
* In terms of data I intend to use, I have three main sources I intend to work my way through, from simple to complex: **(1)** will be starting with ingesting CSV files I get from third-party free data providers like Kaggle, **(2)** then moving on to structured databases from sports stat sites such as BBREF, before  eventually work my way to **(3)** automating data collection from publicly available video games I normally play (Dota 2, Path of Exile -- if it matters)
* I want to be able to load these into SQL tables that I can regularly query form

**2. Data Querying and Extract Cloud Storage**

* I want to then be able to set it up so that I can easily query and then store-via-cloud what I need.
* To make my intention clear, most of my work experience is with AWS Athena and S3, so I hope to get platforms that function similarly.

**3. Cloud-Based Data Processing, Machine Learning, and Visualization**

* I currently do majority of my post-query data processing and modelling locally on my work laptop on Jupyter (via the Anaconda distribution), but one of my key objectives is learning to do all of these on cloud (especially since my peronal computer I'll be using would obviously not be as powerful as what I use for work)
* I definitely prefer Notebook-like environments, so perhaps something like AWS EMR
* My main experience at this level is mainly with Python (using specific packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Numpy, Sklearn, etc.), but I'm looking to do more PySpark as well

**4. EXTRA/OPTIONAL: Dashboard Creation and Hosting**

* If I can get a platform/pipeline that will allow me to host interactive dashboards for me to just embed in my portfolio, that would be a plus, but I am very easily willing to drop this should it not fit my budget

#  Final Remarks

* Want to learn ETL, and cloud-based data processing on a personal data pipeline and processing platform/solution that also has SQL capabilities -- in line with my career and personal learning objectives for the year 
* Tried looking into personal subscriptions for 360 solutions like Databricks and AWS Sagemaker Unified Studio, but was told that for what I want I might be better off with patching together T2 solutions or something along those lines -- but I imagine this would be much more tricky to set up ",2,1,bacon9001,2025-03-30 14:20:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jndfr9/building_a_cloudbased_data_pipeline_for_personal/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-30 14:20:16,14,Sunday,778.0,4571,1.95,11,1197,22.0,0,1

This is my current setup: client sends a request to cloudfront that manages the cache and triggers a lambda for a cache miss to query from MongoDB. I also use signedurl for security purposes for each request. 

I am not an expert that but I think cloud front can handle DDoS attacks etc. Does this setup work or do I need to bring in API Gateway into the fold? I don’t have any user login etc. and no form on the website (no sql injection risk I guess). I don’t know much about network security etc but have heard horror stories of websites getting hacked etc. Hence am a bit paranoid before launching the website. 

Based on some reading, I came to the conclusion that I need to use AWS WAF + API Gateway for dynamic queries and AWS + cloud front for static pages. And lambda should be associated with API Gateway to connect with MongoDB and API Gateway does rate limiting and caching (user authentication is no big a problem here). I wonder if cloudfront is even needed or should just stick with the current architecture I have.

21,1jnktzw,Passed DP-203 -- some thoughts on its retiring,"i took the Azure DP-203 last week — of course, it’s retiring literally tomorrow. But I figured it is indeed a very broad certification and so it can give a ""grounding"" scope in Azure D.E.

Also, I think it's still super early to go full Fabric (DP-600 or even DP-700), because the job demand is still not really there. Most jobs still demand strong grounding in Azure services even in the wake of Fabric adoption (POCing…).

So of course here, it’s retiring literally tomorrow unfortunately. I have passed the exam with a high score (900+). Also, I have worked (during internship) directly with MS Fabric only. So I would say some skills actually transfer quite nicely (ex: ADF ~ FDF).

---

### Some notes on resources for future exams:

I have relied primarily on [@tybulonazure](https://www.youtube.com/@tybulonazure)’s excellent YouTube channel (DP-203 playlist). It’s really great (watch on 1.8x – 2x speed).  
Now going back to Fabric, I have seen he has pivoted to Fabric-centric content — also a great news!

I also used the official “Guide” book (2024 version), which I found to be a surprisingly good way of structuring your learning. I hope equivalents for Fabric will be similar (TBS…).

---

The labs on Microsoft Learn are honestly **poorly designed** for what they offer.  
**Tip:** @tybul has video labs too — *use these*.  
And for the exams, always focus on **conceptual understanding**, not rote memorization.

Another **important (and mostly ignored)** tip:  
Focus on the **“best practices”** sections of Azure services in Microsoft Learn — I’ve read a lot of MS documentation, and those parts are often more helpful on the exam than the main pages.

---

**Examtopics** is obviously very helpful — but **read the comments**, they’re essential!

---

Finally, I do think it’s a shame it’s retiring — because the “traditional” Azure environment knowledge seems to be a sort of industry standard for companies. Also, the Fabric pricing model seems quite aggressive.

So for juniors, it would have been really good to still be able to have this background knowledge as a base layer.",16,2,EducatedEarthian-99,2025-03-30 19:48:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jnktzw/passed_dp203_some_thoughts_on_its_retiring/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-30 19:48:14,19,Sunday,344.0,2100,56.86,23,525,11.2,1,0

I've been interviewing for a proper Junior Data Engineer position and have been doing well in the rounds so far. I've done my recruiter call, HR call and coding assessment. Waiting on the 4th.

I want to be great. I am willing to learn from those of you who are more experienced than me.  
  
Can anyone share examples from their own careers on attitude, communication, soft skills, time management, charisma, willingness to learn and other soft skills that I should keep in mind. Or maybe what I should not do instead.

How should I approach the technical side? There are 1000's of technologies to learn. So I have been learning basics with soft skills and hoping everything works out.

3 years ago I had a labour job and did well in that too. So this grind has caused me to rewire my brain to work in tech and corporate work. I am aiming for 20 years more in this field.

24,1jni0xm,Transitioning from DE to ML Engineer in 2025?,"I am a DE with 2 years of experience, but my background is mainly in statistics. I have been offered a position as an ML Engineer (de facto Data Scientist, but also working on deployment - it is a smaller IT department, so my scope of duties will be simply quite wide). 

The position is interesting, and there are multiple pros and cons to it (that I do not want to discuss in this post). However my question is a bit more general - in 2025, with all the LLMs performing quite well with code generation and fixing, which path would you say is more stable long-term - sticking to DE and becoming better and better at it, or moving more towards ML and doing data science projects?

Furthermore, I also wonder about growth in each field - in ML/DS, my fear is that I am not PhD nor excellent mathematician. In DE, on the other hand, my fear is lack of my solid CS/SWE foundations (as my background is more in statistics). 

Ultimately, it is just an honest question, as I am very curious of your perspective on the matter - does moving towards data science projects (XGBoost and other algorithms) in 2025 from DE (PySpark and Airflow) makes sense in 2025? Which path would you say is more reasonable, and what kind of growth I can expect for each position? Personally I am a bit reluctant to switch simply since I have already dedicated 2 years to growing as an DE, but on the other hand I also see how much more and more of my tasks can be automated.

In June 2022, I joined my second company as a Data Engineer, but after just six months, the project was shelved, and I was moved to a Java-based project (Spring Boot, Kafka, etc.). This happened during a market downturn and layoffs, so I was grateful to still have a job.

Now, after two years in this role, I feel stuck. I struggle with coding, don’t enjoy Java, and constantly feel like an imposter. I know for sure that I don’t want to continue in Java and Spring Boot. However, I’ve stayed in this role because it’s high-paying, and I have family responsibilities (supporting a family of five).

I want to transition back into Data Engineering, but now the job market expects a higher level of expertise given my experience and salary range. I’m unsure about the best way to upskill and make this switch without a major setback.

How can I strategically transition back into Data Engineering while balancing financial stability? Would love advice from those who have made similar career shifts.

I see these terms vary across many architecture ex: In spark they mention these terminologies when the data needs to searched at different instances.. they say data needs to be de-serialised which takes time...

But I am not clear how do I need to think when I hear these terminologies!!!

36,1jnlsu5,Example for complex data pipeline,"Hi community,

After working as a data analyst for several years, I've noticed a gap in tools for interactively exploring complex ETL pipeline dependencies. Many solutions handle smaller pipelines well, but struggle with 200+ tasks.

For larger pipelines, we need robust traversal features, like collapsing/expanding nodes to focus on specific sections during development or debugging. I've used `networkx` and `mermaid` for subgraph visualization, but an interactive UI would be more efficient.

I've developed a prototype and am seeking example cases to test it. I'm looking for pipelines with 60+ tasks and complex dependencies. I'm particularly interested in the challenges you face with these large pipelines. At my workplace, we have a 1500+ task pipeline, and I'm curious if this is a typical scale.

Specifically, I'd like to know:

* What challenges do you face when visualizing and managing large pipelines?
* Are pipelines with 1500+ tasks common?
* What features would you find most useful in a tool for this purpose?

If you can share sanitized examples or describe the complexity of your pipelines, it would be very helpful.

38,1jndfr9,Building a Cloud-Based Data Pipeline for Personal Use/Learning/Projects,"I am a data/functional analyst looking to get a better grasp on 'end-to-end data management and processing' (in quotations as that's the term my direct lead used when we aligned regarding my career objectives for the year, which definitely matches with my current interests).

Given this objective, my own interest in gaining a better grasp on general principles and functions of Data Engineering (and later on, Data Science), as well as a personal project I'm looking to finish for myself/my own portfolio by the end of the year, I'm looking for a cloud-based data pipeline solution for me to spend my role's training stipend on -- though I'm willing (and allowed) to use some of my personal funds on this as well since it's both for career progression and personal fun.

I started looking for small-scale subscriptions for some of the platforms we've previously used at work (AWS, Databricks), but the consensus I've gotten is that cost-wise, I'm potentially better off with multiple smaller platforms that I can just weave together, instead of going for platforms normally designed for enterprise use. And so I come here for help!

*(Though if this is not the right community for me to ask this, please let me know where instead)*

# Budget and Scope

* Base budget is a $200 stipend from our department, which refreshes at the end of the year
* I'm willing to add another $200-300/year, if necessary
* I'm from South-East Asia (converting our local currency, in case regional pricing matters)
* I prefer platforms/solutions that come with upfront costs instead of per-pull/use costs, so that's it's easier to manage the finances involved
* Languages I'm comfortable with are Python and SQL, since these are what I mainly use for work, but willing to learn basics of new languages where necessary 
* Since I will be using my personal computer, which is not that powerful currently, I am looking for a pipeline/platform that I can use completely via cloud (including running training models) 

# Learning Objectives 

*(aka things I want my platform/s to be able to do)*

**1. Data Gathering/Ingestion/Validation/Transformation/Storage**

* Obviously not too familiar with this step currently, so I ended up lumping a bunch of them together, but essentially ETL
* In terms of data I intend to use, I have three main sources I intend to work my way through, from simple to complex: **(1)** will be starting with ingesting CSV files I get from third-party free data providers like Kaggle, **(2)** then moving on to structured databases from sports stat sites such as BBREF, before  eventually work my way to **(3)** automating data collection from publicly available video games I normally play (Dota 2, Path of Exile -- if it matters)
* I want to be able to load these into SQL tables that I can regularly query form

**2. Data Querying and Extract Cloud Storage**

* I want to then be able to set it up so that I can easily query and then store-via-cloud what I need.
* To make my intention clear, most of my work experience is with AWS Athena and S3, so I hope to get platforms that function similarly.

**3. Cloud-Based Data Processing, Machine Learning, and Visualization**

* I currently do majority of my post-query data processing and modelling locally on my work laptop on Jupyter (via the Anaconda distribution), but one of my key objectives is learning to do all of these on cloud (especially since my peronal computer I'll be using would obviously not be as powerful as what I use for work)
* I definitely prefer Notebook-like environments, so perhaps something like AWS EMR
* My main experience at this level is mainly with Python (using specific packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Numpy, Sklearn, etc.), but I'm looking to do more PySpark as well

**4. EXTRA/OPTIONAL: Dashboard Creation and Hosting**

* If I can get a platform/pipeline that will allow me to host interactive dashboards for me to just embed in my portfolio, that would be a plus, but I am very easily willing to drop this should it not fit my budget

#  Final Remarks

* Want to learn ETL, and cloud-based data processing on a personal data pipeline and processing platform/solution that also has SQL capabilities -- in line with my career and personal learning objectives for the year 
* Tried looking into personal subscriptions for 360 solutions like Databricks and AWS Sagemaker Unified Studio, but was told that for what I want I might be better off with patching together T2 solutions or something along those lines -- but I imagine this would be much more tricky to set up ",1,1,bacon9001,2025-03-30 14:20:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jndfr9/building_a_cloudbased_data_pipeline_for_personal/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-30 14:20:16,14,Sunday,778.0,4571,1.95,11,1197,22.0,0,1

we’re currently using self-hosted Airflow for our internal ETL and data workflows. It gets the job done, but I never really liked it. Feels too far away from actual Python, gets overly complex at times, and local development and testing is honestly a nightmare.

I recently stumbled upon Prefect and gave the self-hosted version a try. Really liked what I saw. Super Pythonic, easy to set up locally, modern UI - just felt right from the start.

But the problem is: the open-source version doesn’t offer user management or logging, so we’d need the Cloud version. Pricing would be around 30k USD per year, which is way above what we pay for Airflow. Even with a discount, it would still be too much for us.

Is there any way to make the community version work for a small team? Usermanagement and Audit-Logs is definitely a must for us. Or is Prefect just not realistic without going Cloud?

Would be a shame, because I really liked their approach.

57,1jo9b0k,Operating systems and hardware available for employees in your company,"Hey guys,

I'm working as a DE in a German IT company that has about 500 employees. The company's policy regarding operating systems the employees are allowed to use is strange and unfair (IMO). All software engineers get access to Macbooks and thus, to MacOS while all other employees that have a differnt job title ""only"" get HP elite books (that are not elite at all) that run on Windows. WSL is allowed but a native Linux is not accepted because of security reasons (I don't know which security reasons).

As far as I know the company does not want other job positions to get Macbooks because the whole updating stuff for those Macbooks  is done by an external company which is quite expensive. The Windows laptops instead are maintained by an internal team.

A lot of people are very unhappy with this situation because many of them (including me) would prefer to use Linux or MacOS. Especially all DevOps are pissed because half a year ago they also got access to MacBooks but a change in the policy means that they will have to change back to Windows laptops once their MacBooks break or become too old.

My question(s): Can you choose the OS and/or hardware in your company? Do you have a clue why Linux may not be accepted? Is it really not that safe (which I cannot think of because the company has it's own data center where a lot of Linux servers run that are actually updated by an internal team)?",2,11,VeryHardToFindAName,2025-03-31 17:48:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jo9b0k/operating_systems_and_hardware_available_for/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-03-31 17:48:33,17,Monday,255.0,1410,56.39,11,382,12.7,0,0

59,1joeg88,My company adopted a stateful REST API solution I built that's run locally on every machine. I would like to deploy it to the cloud but I am not sure that's smart. Thoughts?,"**Context:** I joined a finance consultancy a few years ago and noticed that most people in my department are frustrated with the current ""software"" our engineering team has built over decades (yes - not years, decades). The issue is that the software consists of a bundle of Python scripts that repeatedly read large CSV files whenever a user interacts with it. The master CSV file ranges in size from 20MB to 1GB.

For example, if a user wants to select an option from a dropdown menu, clicking the dropdown triggers the reading and aggregation of a 1GB file, after which the frontend is ""returned"" 20 strings (the dropdown options). By ""returned,"" I mean that a new CSV file is created somewhere on the user's local file system, and the ""frontend"" picks it up. I tested a similar functionality using a Flask REST API, and once the CSV file is loaded into virtual memory, the process takes only 100ms—compared to the current design, which takes a full minute (some of it is due to scripts needing to sort out dependencies, validation, etc.). However, our engineering team refuses to adopt web-based communication, arguing that it's not worth the effort. The idea of using a cloud-based relational database is essentially taboo; it has to be either CSV files or Python’s pickle dumps on each user's local system.

I have some experience in software engineering, so I made it my mission to redesign this legacy monster—with the blessing of a senior manager. So far, the transition has gone incredibly well. Last year, I did a soft launch of a small subset of features, and within days, every person in my department was using it.

**Question:** My current design requires users to set up a virtual environment and run an installation script that sorts out any environment variables, dependencies, etc. Each time they want to start the software, they must run a local Flask API, which interacts with a React TypeScript frontend. When the Flask API starts, it loads all necessary files into memory, does validation and other things (takes around a minute). After that, every subsequent request is easy and takes on average 100 to 200 ms. However, I dislike that each user needs a fully configured environment. Version control is also a headache since every user must manually run an update script.

I’d like to move my Flask API to the cloud so that either:

1. **A single server serves all colleagues**, or
2. **Each colleague gets a dedicated node/pod.**

The problem with a single server is that it would quickly run out of virtual memory if 100+ colleagues loaded large datasets simultaneously. The problem with one node per colleague is the complexity—it would require Kubernetes (K8s) or AWS Fargate, along with an orchestrator to manage node creation and termination, which is a significant engineering effort.

I then considered making my Flask API stateless: storing large datasets in S3, using DynamoDB for file mapping, and loading data into virtual memory on every request. I converted some sample datasets to Parquet, reducing their size significantly (down to \~10MB), but I worry about added latency. Repeatedly reading the same data (given that each user makes 1–10 requests per minute) seems highly inefficient.

Am I missing any alternatives? Based on this, a local Flask API still seems like the best option—unless I want to pay for an expensive 64GB vRAM EC2 instance or invest significant time in building a node-per-user architecture.

60,1jnymqg,Need Feedback on data sharing module,"
Subject: Seeking Feedback: CrossLink - Faster Data Sharing Between Python/R/C++/Julia via Arrow & Shared Memory

Hey r/dataengineering


I've been working on a project called CrossLink aimed at tackling a common bottleneck: efficiently sharing large datasets (think multi-million row Arrow tables / Pandas DataFrames / R data.frames) between processes written in different languages (Python, R, C++, Julia) when they're running on the same machine/node.
Mainly given workflows where teams have different language expertise.

The Problem:
We often end up saving data to intermediate files (CSVs are slow, Parquet is better but still involves disk I/O and serialization/deserialization overhead) just to pass data from, say, a Python preprocessing script to an R analysis script, or a C++ simulation output to Python for plotting. This can dominate runtime for data-heavy pipelines.

CrossLink's Approach:
The idea is to create a high-performance IPC (Inter-Process Communication) layer specifically for this, leveraging:
Apache Arrow: As the common, efficient in-memory columnar format.
Shared Memory / Memory-Mapped Files: Using Arrow IPC format over these mechanisms for potential minimal-copy data transfer between processes on the same host.


DuckDB: To manage persistent metadata about the shared datasets (unique IDs, names, schemas, source language, location - shmem key or mmap path) and allow optional SQL queries across them.


Essentially, it tries to create a shared data pool where different language processes can push and pull Arrow tables with minimal overhead.


Performance:
Early benchmarks on a 100M row Python -> R pipeline are encouraging, showing CrossLink is:
Roughly 16x faster than passing data via CSV files.
Roughly 2x faster than passing data via disk-based Arrow/Parquet files.

It also now includes a streaming API with backpressure and disk-spilling capabilities for handling >RAM datasets.


Architecture:
It's built around a C++ core library (libcrosslink) handling the Arrow serialization, IPC (shmem/mmap via helper classes), and DuckDB metadata interactions. Language bindings (currently Python & R functional, Julia building) expose this functionality idiomatically.


Seeking Feedback:
I'd love to get your thoughts, especially on:
Architecture: Does using Arrow + DuckDB + (Shared Mem / MMap) seem like a reasonable approach for this problem? 

Any obvious pitfalls or complexities I might be underestimating (beyond the usual fun of shared memory management and cross-platform IPC)?


Usefulness: Is this data transfer bottleneck a significant pain point you actually encounter in your work? Would a library like CrossLink potentially fit into your workflows (e.g., local data science pipelines, multi-language services running on a single server, HPC node-local tasks)?


Alternatives: What are you currently using to handle this? (Just sticking with Parquet on shared disk? Using something like Ray's object store if you're in that ecosystem? Redis? Other IPC methods?)


Appreciate any constructive criticism or insights you might have! Happy to elaborate on any part of the design.

I built this to ease the pain of moving across different scripts and languages for a single file. Wanted to know if it useful for any of you here and would be a sensible open source project to maintain.

It is currently built only for local nodes, but looking to add support with arrow flight across nodes as well.

Although both devices measure the same phenomenon and I've converted the units to be consistent, I'm unsure whether this is sufficient for meaningful comparison, given that the devices themselves are different and may have distinct ranges or variances.

From the literature, I’ve found that z-score normalization is commonly used to address such issues. However, I’m concerned that applying z-score normalization to each dataset individually might make it impossible to compare across datasets, especially when I want to analyze multiple sessions or subjects later.

Is z-score normalization the right approach in this case? Or would it be better to normalize using a common reference (e.g., using statistics from a larger dataset)?

66,1jo4n51,Seeking Advice from DE: Taking a Career Break to Work & Travel in Australia,"Hey DE,

I’d love to get your perspective on my situation.

# My Background

I’m a Brazilian Mechanical Engineer with 3 years of experience in the Data field—started as a Data Analyst for 1.5 years, then transitioned into Data Engineering. Next week, I’ll be starting as a Data Architect at a multinational with 100,000+ employees, mainly working with the Azure stack.

# The Plan

My girlfriend and I are planning to move to Australia for about a year to travel and build memories together before settling down (marriage, house, etc.). This new job came unexpectedly, but it offers a good salary (\~$2,000 USD/month).

The idea is to:

* Move to Australia
* Work hard & save around $1,000 USD/month
* Travel as much as possible for \~2 years
* Return and re-enter the data field

# The Challenge

The work visa limitation allows me to stay only 6 months with the same employer, making it tough to get good Data Engineering jobs. So, I plan to work in any job that pays well (fruit picking, hospitality, etc.), and my girlfriend will do the same.

# The Concern

When I return, how hard will it be to get back into the data field after a \~2-year break?

* I’ll have enough savings to stay unemployed for about a year if needed.
* This isn’t all my savings—I have the equivalent of 6 years of salary in reserve.

While this is very nice for me, I can’t say the same about the projects I encounter. What I mean is that I was expecting the engineering soundness of the projects I encounter to grow alongside my seniority in this field.

Instead, I’ve found that regardless of where I end up (the last two companies were data consulting shops), the projects I am assigned to tend to have questionable engineering decisions (often involving an unnecessary use of Spark to move 7 rows of data).

The latest one involves ETL out of MSSQL and into object storage, using a combination of Azure synapse spark notebooks, drag and drop GUI pipelines, absolutely no tests or CICD whatsoever, and debatable modeling once data lands in the lake.

This whole thing scares me quite a lot due to the lack of guardrails, while testing and deployments are done manually. While I'd love to rewrite everything from scratch, my eng lead said since that part it's complete and there isn't a plan to change it in the future, that it's not a priority at all, and I agree with this.

1. Campaigns (id, name, start time, stop time)
2. Ad Groups/Ad Sets (id, name)
3. Ads (id, name, URL)
4. Metrics (clicks, impressions, spend) for the previous day

For the Google Ads API, you basically send a SQL query and the return time is like a tenth of a second.

For Facebook, we see returns times in the minutes, especially on the Ads piece. Was hoping to get an idea of how others might have successfully set up a process to get this data from Facebook in a more timely fashion, and possibly without hitting the rate limiting threshold.

Not the exact code we're using - I can get it off my work system tomorrow - but the gist:

    from facebook_business.adobjects.adaccount import AdAccount
    from facebook_business.adobjects.campaign import Campaign
    from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import AdSet
    from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import Ad
    from facebook_business.adobjects.adcreative import AdCreative
    campaigns = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_campaigns(
        params={},
        fields=[Campaign.Field.id,Campaign.Field.name,Campaign.Field.start_time,Campaign.Field.stop_time]
    )
    adsets= AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_sets(
        params={},

    ads = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ads(
        params={},
        fields=[Ad.Field.id,Ad.Field.name,Ad.Field.creative]
    )
    object_urls = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_creatives(
        params={},

        params={},
        fields=[AdCreative.Field.asset_feed_spec]
    )

We then have to do some joining between ads/object\_urls/asset\_urls to match the Ad with the destination URL if the ad is clicked on.

The performance is so slow, that I hope we are doing it wrong. I was never able to get the batch call to work and I'm not sure how to improve things.

A few months ago I was moved to a smallish project with the objective of streamlining some administrative tasks that were all calculated ""manually"" with Excel.  By the time, all I had worked with were very basic, low code tools from the Microsoft enviroment: PBI for dashboards, Power Automate, Power Apps for data entry, Sharepoint lists, etc, so that's what I used to set it up. 

The cost for the client is basically nonexistent right now, apart from a couple of PBI licenses. The closest I've done to ETL work has been with power query, if you can even call it that. 

  
Now I'm at a point where it feels like that's not gonna cut it anymore. I'm going to be working with larger volumes of data, with more complex relationships between tables and transformations that need to be done earlier in the process. I could technically keep going with what I have but I want to actually build something durable and move towards actual data engineering, but I don't know where to start with a solution that's cost efficient and well structured. For example, I wanted to move the data from Sharepoint lists to a proper database but then we'd have to pay for multiple premium licenses to be able to connect to them in powerapps. Where do I even start?

I know the very basics of data engineering and I've done a couple of tutorial projects with Snowflake and Databricks as my team seems to want to focus on cloud based solutions.

95,1jp4f74,Built a visual tool on top of Pandas that runs Python transformations row-by-row - What do you guys think?,"Hey data engineers,

For client implementations I thought it was a pain to write python scripts over and over, so I built a tool on top of Pandas to solve my own frustration and as a personal hobby. The goal was to make it so I didn't have to start from the ground up and rewrite and keep track of each script for each data source I had.

**What I Built:**  
A visual transformation tool with some features I thought might interest this community:

1. **Python execution on a row-by-row basis** \- Write Python once per field, save the mapping, and process. It applies each field's mapping logic to each row and returns the result without loops
2. **Visual logic builder** that generates Python from the drag and drop interface. It can re-parse the python so you can go back and edit form the UI again
3. **AI Co-Pilot** that can write Python logic based on your requirements
4. **No environment setup** \- just upload your data and start transforming
5. **Handles nested JSON** with a simple dot notation for complex structures

Here's a screenshot of the logic builder in action:

I'd love some feedback from people who deal with data transformations regularly. If anyone wants to give it a try feel free to shoot me a message or comment, and I can give you lifetime access if the app is of use. Not trying to sell here, just looking for some feedback and thoughts since I just built it.

**Technical Details:**

* Supports CSV, Excel, and JSON inputs/outputs, concatenating files, header & delimiter selection
* Transformations are saved as editable mapping files
* Handles large datasets by processing chunks in parallel
* Built on Pandas. Supports Pandas and re libraries

102,1jpkgey,Does anyone feel the DE tools are chaging too fast to track,"TL;DR: a guy feeling stuck in the job and cannot figure out what skills are needed to move to a better position 

I am data engineer at a big 4 firm (may be just a etl developer) in india.

I work with Informatica Power Center, Oracle, Unix on the daily basis. Now, when I tried to switch companies for career boost, I realised nobody uses these tech anymore. 

Everyone uses pyspark for etl.
I though fair enough and started leaning pyspark dataframe api. I am so good with sql, pl/sql and python, so it was easy for me.

Then I came to know learning pyspark is not enough, you need to know databricks, snowflake, dbt kind of tools.

Even before making my mind to decide what to learn, things changed and now airflow/dagster, redshift, delta lake, duckdb. I don't what else is in trend now.

Honestly, It feels a lot, like the world is moving in the fastest pace possible and I cannot even decide what to do.

Every job has different tools, and to do the ""fake it till you make it"", I am afraid they would ask any niche question about the tool to which you can only answer if you have the experience.

My profile  is not even getting picked and I feel stuck in the job I am doing.

I am great at what I do, that is one reason the project is not letting me leave even after all the senior folks has left for better projects. The guy with 3 years of experience is the senior most developer and lead now.

But honestly, I dont think I can make it anymore.

If I was just stuck with something like SAP ABAP, frontend or core python, things might have been good. Recruiters will at least look at your profile even though you are not a perfect match as you can learn the rest to do the job. (I might be wrong in this thought)

But for DE roles, the job descriptions are becoming too specific to a tool and people are expecting complete data architect level of skills at 3 years.

110,1jpxfch,"New to Data Engineering — Feeling a Bit Overwhelmed, Looking for Advice","Hey everyone, I could really use some advice from fellow engineers. I'm pretty new to the data world — I messed up uni, then did an online analytics course, and after about a year and a half of grinding, I finally landed my first role. Along the way, I found a real passion for Python and SQL.

My first job involved a ton of patchy reporting because of messy infra and data. I started automating painful tasks using basic ETL pipelines I built myself. I showed an interest in APIs and, out of nowhere, 6 months in, I was offered a data engineering role.

Fast forward to now — I’ve been in the new role for a month, and I’m the company’s only data engineer. I’m doing a data engineering apprenticeship at the same time, which helps, but the imposter syndrome is real. The company’s been limping along with a 25-year-old piece of software that populates our SQL Server DB, and we’re now migrating to something new. I’ve been asked to learn MuleSoft for ETL and replace some existing pipelines that were built in Python.

I love the subject — I’m genuinely passionate about programming and networking — and I’m keen to take on new tech, improve the infra, and build up strong skills. But I’m not sure if I’m going too deep too fast. For example, today I was learning Docker to deploy Python scripts, just to avoid issues with hundreds of brittle batch files that break if we update Python.

My boss seems to think MuleSoft will fully replace Python, but I see it more as a tool that complements certain workflows rather than a full replacement. What worries me more is that I don’t really have any technical peers. Most people in my team only know basic SQL, and it’s hard to communicate strategy or get proper feedback.

My current priorities are getting comfortable with MuleSoft, Git, and Docker. I’m constantly learning, but sometimes I leave work feeling overwhelmed. There’s so much broken or duct-taped together, I don’t even know where to start. I keep telling myself I don’t need to “save the world,” but I really want to do a good job and come away with solid experience.

Long term, they want to deploy this new software, rebuild the database, and eventually use AI to help employees query the business. There’s a shit ton to do, and I’m still figuring out basics — like setting up a VM just so I can run Docker.

Am I jumping the gun with how I’m feeling, or is this as wild a situation as it seems?

118,1jplvx0,Suggestions for workflow automation,"Hey there :)

  
I hope I find myself in the right subreddit for this as I am trying to **engineer** my computer to push around some **data** ;) 

I'm currently working on a project to fully automate the processing of test results for a scientific study with students. 

The workflow consists of several stages:

1. **Data Extraction:** The test data is extracted from a local SQL database.
2. **SPSS Processing:** The extracted data is then processed using SPSS with a custom-built syntax (legacy). This step generates multiple files from the data. I have been looking into how I can transition this syntax to a python script, so this step might be cut later.
3. **Python Automation:** A Python script takes over the further processing. It reads the files, splits the data per class, inserts it into pre-designed Excel reporting templates.
4. **File Upload:** The files are then automatically uploaded to a self-hosted Nextcloud instance.
5. **Notification:** Once the workflow is complete, a notification  

I have been thinking about different ways to implement this. Right now the inputs and outputs for the different steps are still done manually. 

At work I have been using Jenkins lately and I think it feels natural  to do it in Jenkins and just describe the whole workflow in a pipeline with different stages to run. Besides that I have some experience with AWS Lambda and n8n but I am not sure if they would be helpful with this task.

I´m not that experienced setting up such workflows as my work background is more in Infosec, so please forgive my uneducated guesses about how I best go about this :D Just trying not to take decisions that will be problematic later.

120,1jpdpyh,Facebook Marketing API - Anyone have a successful ETL experience?,"We have a python integration set up where we pull data from Google Ads and Facebook Marketing into our data warehouse. We're pulling data about all 3 hierarchy tiers and some daily metrics:

1. Campaigns (id, name, start time, stop time)
2. Ad Groups/Ad Sets (id, name)
3. Ads (id, name, URL)
4. Metrics (clicks, impressions, spend) for the previous day

For the Google Ads API, you basically send a SQL query and the return time is like a tenth of a second.

For Facebook, we see returns times in the minutes, especially on the Ads piece. Was hoping to get an idea of how others might have successfully set up a process to get this data from Facebook in a more timely fashion, and possibly without hitting the rate limiting threshold.

Not the exact code we're using - I can get it off my work system tomorrow - but the gist:

    from facebook_business.adobjects.adaccount import AdAccount
    from facebook_business.adobjects.campaign import Campaign
    from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import AdSet
    from facebook_business.adobjects.ad import Ad
    from facebook_business.adobjects.adcreative import AdCreative
    campaigns = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_campaigns(
        params={},
        fields=[Campaign.Field.id,Campaign.Field.name,Campaign.Field.start_time,Campaign.Field.stop_time]
    )
    adsets= AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_sets(
        params={},
        fields=[AdSet.Field.id,AdSet.Field.name]
    )
    ads = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ads(
        params={},
        fields=[Ad.Field.id,Ad.Field.name,Ad.Field.creative]
    )
    object_urls = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_creatives(
        params={},
        fields=[AdCreative.Field.object_story_spec]
    )
    asset_urls = AdAccount('act_123456789').get_ad_creatives(
        params={},
        fields=[AdCreative.Field.asset_feed_spec]
    )

We then have to do some joining between ads/object\_urls/asset\_urls to match the Ad with the destination URL if the ad is clicked on.

The performance is so slow, that I hope we are doing it wrong. I was never able to get the batch call to work and I'm not sure how to improve things.

I’m working on a project that involves building a comprehensive overview of all therapist-related businesses in my country. I’ve found a public online source that lists approximately 16,000 such businesses, spread across many paginated result pages.

Each entry links to a detail page with information such as:

Business name
Business owner (person or legal entity)
Registration number (similar to a company ID)
Location (optional)
No consistent link to a website, but it's often listed in the details

What I need help with:

(1) Scrape all business data into a structured list (CSV, JSON or database).
This involves crawling through all paginated pages and collecting each business profile’s content.

(2) Automatically search for a homepage/website for each business.
The source doesn't always list websites, so for those missing, I'd like to auto-search Google (or use a business API if necessary) to find the most likely company homepage.
(3) If a homepage is found: scrape relevant data from the website itself.

Goal:
To build a clean, filterable dataset that can be used for matching clients with therapists (via a separate platform I'm developing).

Questions I’d like help with:

Is this technically feasible using open tools or affordable APIs? What/who exactly would I be looking for? I have tried navigating Fiverr, but I am simply not sure what I need to be frank...

So I've been working on a solution for the past few months called [**Boring Data**](http://boringdata.io).

It's a set of Terraform templates ready to be deployed in AWS and/or Snowflake with pre-built integrations for ELT tools and orchestrators.

I think these templates are a great fit for many projects:

* Pay once, own it forever
* Get started fast
* Full control

I'd love to get feedback on this approach, which isn't very common (from what I've seen) in the data industry.

Is Terraform commonly used on your teams, or is that a barrier to using templates like these?

134,1jpj0a0,Is my career choice taking me away from Data engineering jobs ?,"Hello everyone,

First of all English is not my first language so I apologize if there are mistakes or if everything is not clear.

I've been working for 6 years and my career path is not very consistent.  
I started in non-technical positions for 3 years and then moved on to a more technical one. 

For 3 years I had a very diversified job with software development (Php, Python), database management, Linux system administration, a bit of Cloud and a big part of “Data” with ETL flows (Talend) and a lot of SQL. The project was quite large and the team very small, so I was working on several tasks at once.

I really enjoyed the Data part and I got it into my head that I wanted to be a 'real' Data Engineer and not just drag and drop on Talend.

I was just starting my research when a friend of mine contacted me because a software engineer position was opening up in his company. I went through the recruitment process and accepted their proposal.

  
As in my previous position, I'll be working on a lot of things (mobile development, backend, a bit of frontend, cloud, devops) and the salary offered was 20% higher than what I had in my previous job. (I'm now at 48k€ and I don't live in a big city).  
The offer was really attractive and as the market is a bit complicated at the moment, I accepted.

But I'm wondering if this choice will take me even further away from the Data Engineer job i wanted.

Do you find my career path coherent?  
Could I switch back to Data in a few years' time?

137,1jpqnx3,I Want To Improve an Internal Process At My Company,"Hey r/dataengineering,

I'm currently transitioning from a software engineering role to data engineering, and I've identified a potential project at my company that I think would be a great learning experience and a chance to introduce some data engineering best practices.

Project Overview:

We have a dashboard that displays employee utilization data, sourced from two main systems: Harvest (time tracking) and Forecast (projected utilization).

Current Process:

* Harvest Data: Currently, we're using cron jobs running on an EC2 instance to periodically pull data from Harvest.
* Forecast Data: Due to the lack of an API, we're relying on Playwright (web scraping) to extract data from their web reports, which are then saved to S3.
* Data Processing: Another cron job on EC2 processes the S3 reports and loads the data into a PostgreSQL database.
* Dashboard: A custom frontend application (using Azure OAuth) queries the PostgreSQL database to display the utilization data.

Proposed Solution:

I'm proposing a serverless architecture on AWS, using the following components:

* API Gateway + Lambda: To create a robust API for our frontend application.
* Lambda for ETL: To automate data extraction, transformation, and loading from Harvest and Forecast.
* AWS Step Functions: To orchestrate the data pipeline and manage dependencies.
* Amazon RDS PostgreSQL: To serve as our data warehouse for analytical queries.
* API Gateway Authorizer: To integrate Azure OAuth authentication.
* CI/CD with CodePipeline and CodeBuild: To automate testing and deployment.
* Docker and SAM CLI: For local development and testing.

My Goals:

* Gain hands-on experience with AWS serverless technologies.
* Implement data engineering best practices for ETL and data warehousing.
* Improve the reliability and scalability of our data pipeline.
* Potentially expand this architecture to serve as a central data warehouse for other company analytical data.

My Questions:

1. For those with experience in similar projects, what are some key considerations or potential challenges I should be aware of?
2. Any advice on best practices for designing and implementing a serverless data pipeline on AWS?
3. Are there any specific AWS services or tools that you would recommend for this project?
4. How would you recommend getting started on a project like this, what would you focus on first?
5. What would be some good ways to test this type of system?

I'm eager to learn and contribute, and I appreciate any insights or advice you can offer.

142,1jr15ej,What's the non-technical biggest barrier you face at work?,"What’s currently challenging for me is getting access to things.

I design a data pipeline, present it to the team that will benefit from it, and everyone gets super excited.

Then I reach out to the internal department or an external party to either grant me admin access to the platform I need, or to help me obtain an API.

A week goes by—nothing. I follow up via email. Eventually, someone replies and says it's not possible to give me admin credentials. Fine. So I ask, “Can you help me get the API instead? It’s very straightforward.”

Another week goes by—still nothing. I send another follow-up…

Now the other person is kind of frustrated (because I’m asking them to do something slightly different, even though I’m offering guidance).

What follows is just a back-and-forth with long, frustrating waiting periods in between. Meanwhile, the team I presented the pipeline or project to starts getting frustrated with me and probably thinks I’m full of crap.

Once I finally get the damn API or whatever access I needed, I complete the project in 1–2 days but delayed by weeks or even months.

148,1jr3z1u,Faster way to view + debug data,"Hi r/dataengineering!

  
I wanted to share a project that I have been working on. It's an intuitive data editor where you can interact with local and remote data (e.g. Athena & BigQuery). For several important tasks, it can speed you up by 10x or more. (see website for more)

  
For data engineering specifically, this would be really useful in debugging pipelines, cleaning local or remote data, and being able to easy create new tables within data warehouses etc.

I know this could be a lot faster than having to type everything out, especially if you're just poking around. I personally find myself using this before trying any manual work.

Also, for those doing complex queries, you can split them up and work with the frame visually and add queries when needed. Super useful for when you want to iteratively build an analysis or new frame ***without writing a super long query.***

  
As for data size, it can handle local data up to around 1B rows, and remote data is only limited by your data warehouse.

  
You don't have to migrate *anything* either.

  
If you're interested, you can check it out here: [https://www.cocoalemana.com](https://www.cocoalemana.com)

  
I'd love to hear about your workflow, and see what we can change to make it cover more data engineering use cases.

  
Cheers!

150,1jr23mk,How do I get out of this rut,"I’m currently about the finish an early career rotational program with a top 10 bank. The rotation I am currently on and where the company is placing me post program (I tried to get placed somewhere else) is as a data engineer on a data delivery team. When I was advertised this rotation and the team I was told pretty specifically we would be using all the relevant technologies and I would be very hands on keyboard building pipelines with python , configuring cloud services and snowflake, being a part of data modeling. Mind you I’m not completely new I have experience with all this in personal projects and previous work experience as a SWE and researcher in college. 

Turns out all of that was a lie. I later learned there is an army of contractors that do the actual work. I was stuck with analyzing .egp files and other SAS files documenting it and handing off to consultants to rebuild in Talend to ingest into snowflake. The only tech that I use is Visio and Word.

I coped with that by saying after I’m out of the program I’ll get to do the actual work. But I had a conversation with my manager today about what my role will be post program. He basically said there are a lot more of these SAS procedures they are porting over to talend and snowflake and I’ll be documenting them and handing over to contractors so they can implement the new process. Honestly that is all really quick and easy to do because there isn’t that much complicated business logic for the LOBs we support just joins and the occasional aggregation so most days I’m not doing anything.

When I told him I would really like to be involved in the technical work or the data modeling , he said that is not my job anymore and that is what we pay the contractors to do so I can’t do it. Almost made it seem like I should be grateful and he is doing me a favor somehow.

It just feels like I was misled or even outright lied to about the position. We don’t use any of the technologies that were advertised (Drag and drop/low code tools seem like fake engineering), I don’t get to be hands on keyboard at all. Just seems like there really I no growth or opportunity in this role. I would leave but I took relocation and a signing bonus for this and if I leave too early I owe it back. I also can’t internally transfer anywhere for a year after starting my new role.

I guess my rant is just to ask what should I be doing in this situation? I work on personal projects and open source and I have gotten a few certs in the downtime at work but I don’t know if it’s enough to make sure my skills don’t atrophy while I wait out my repayment period. I consider myself a somewhat technical guy but I have been boxed into a non technical role.

152,1jramqt,"Airbyte Connector Builder now supports GraphQL, Async Requests and Custom Components","Hello, Marcos from the Airbyte Team.

For those who may not be familiar, Airbyte is an open-source data integration (EL) platform with over 500 connectors for APIs, databases, and file storage.

In our last release we added several new features to our no-code Connector Builder:

* [GraphQL Support](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/config-based/understanding-the-yaml-file/request-options#graphql-request-injection): In addition to REST, you can now make requests to GraphQL APIs (and properly handle pagination!)
* [Async Data Requests](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/connector-builder-ui/async-streams): There are some reporting APIs that do not return responses immediately. For instance, with Google Ads.  You can now request a custom report from these sources and wait for the report to be processed and downloaded.
* [Custom Python Code Components](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/connector-builder-ui/custom-components): We recognize that some APIs behave uniquely—for example, by returning records as key-value pairs instead of arrays or by not ordering data correctly. To address these cases, our open-source platform now supports custom Python components that extend the capabilities of the no-code framework without blocking you from building your connector.

We believe these updates will make connector development faster and more accessible, helping you get the most out of your data integration projects.

We understand there are discussions about the trade-offs between no-code and low-code solutions. At Airbyte, transitioning from fully coded connectors to a low-code approach allowed us to maintain a large connector catalog using standard components.  We were also able to create a better build and test process directly in the UI. Users frequently give us the feedback that the no-code connector Builder enables less technical users to create and ship connectors. This reduces the workload on senior data engineers allowing them to focus on critical data pipelines.

Something else that has been top of mind is speed and performance. With a robust and stable connector framework, the engineering team has been dedicating significant resources to introduce concurrency to enhance sync speed. You can read this[ blog post](https://airbyte.com/blog/improving-connector-sync-speed-up-to-10x-faster) about how the team implemented concurrency in the Klaviyo connector, resulting in a speed increase of about 10x for syncs.

I hope you like the news!

154,1jrd8po,PII Obfuscation in Databricks,"Hi Data Champs,

I have been recently given chance to explore PII obfuscation technique in databricks.

I proposed using sql aes_encryption or python fernet for PII column level encryption before landing to bronze.

And use column masking on delta tables which has built in logic for group membership check and decryption so to avoid the overhead of a new view per table.

My HDE was more interested in sql approach than the fernet but fernet offers built in key rotation out of the box.

Has anyone used aes_encryption 
Is it secure, easy to work with and relatively more robust.

From my experience for data type other than binary like long, int, double it needs to be first converted to binary (don’t like it)

Apart from that usual error here and there for padding and generic error when decrypting sometimes.

as always that's for the insight from other people, I find a lot of these discussions around points very entertaining and very helpful!

I'm having an argument with someone who is several levels above me. This might sound petty so I apologise in advance. It centres around the definition of a Mart. Our Mart is a single Fact with around 20 dimensions. The Fact is extremely wide and deep. Indeed we usually put it into a de normalised table for reporting. To me this isn't a MART as it isn't based on requirements but rather a star schema that supposedly servers multiple purposed or potential purposes. When engaged on requirements the person leans on there experience in the domain and says a user probable wants to do X, Y and Z. I've never seen anything written down. Constantly that report also defers to Kimball methodology and how this follows them closely. My take on the book is that these things need to be based of requirement, business requirements. 

My questions is, is it fair to say that a data mart needs to have requirements and ideally a business domain in mind or else its just a star schema?

When they came to us, their situation was rough. Dashboards taking forever to load, some poor analyst manually combining data from 5 different sources, and their CEO breathing down everyone's neck for daily conversion reports. Classic spreadsheet hell that we've all seen before.

We spent about two weeks redesigning their entire data architecture. Built them a proper [**data warehouse solution** ](https://datafortune.com/services/enterprise-data-management/data-warehouse/)with automated ETL pipelines that consolidated everything into one central location. Created some logical data models and connected it all to their existing BI tools.

The transformation was honestly pretty incredible to watch. Reports that used to take hours now run in seconds. Their analyst actually took a vacation for the first time in a year. And we got this really nice email from their CTO saying we'd ""changed how they make decisions"" which gave us all the warm fuzzies.

It's projects like these that remind us why we got into this field in the first place.

165,1ju81cr,Jira: Is it still helping teams... or just slowing them down?,"I’ve been part of (and led) a teams over the last decade — in enterprises

And one tool keeps showing up everywhere: **Jira**.

It’s the ""default"" for a lot of engineering orgs. Everyone knows it. Everyone uses it.  
But **I don’t seen anyone who actually likes it.**

Not in the *""ugh it's corporate but fine""* way — I mean people who are actively frustrated by it but still use it daily.

Here are some of the most common friction points I’ve either experienced or heard from other devs/product folks:

1. **Custom workflows spiral out of control** — What starts as ""just a few tweaks"" becomes an unmanageable mess.
2. **Slow performance** — Large projects? Boards crawling? Yup.
3. **Search that requires sorcery** — Good luck finding an old ticket without a detailed Jira PhD.
4. **New team members struggle to onboard** — It’s not exactly intuitive.
5. **The “tool tax”** — Teams spend hours updating Jira instead of moving work forward.

And yet... most teams stick with it. Because switching is painful. Because “at least everyone knows Jira.” Because the alternative is more uncertainty.

173,1jusby0,Best way to handle loading JSON API data into database in pipelines,"Greetings, this is my first post here. I've been working in DE for the last 5 years now doing various things with Airflow and Dagster.  I have a question regarding design of data flow from APIs to our database.

I am using Dagster/Python to perform the API pulls and loads into Snowflake.

My team lead insists that we load JSON data into our Snowflake RAW\_DATA in the following way:

ID (should be a surrogate/non-native PK)  
PAYLOAD (raw JSON payload, either as a VARCHAR or VARIANT type)  
CREATED\_DATE (timestamp this row was created in Snowflake)  
UPDATE\_DATE (timestamp this row was updated in Snowflake)

Flattening of the payload then happens in SQL as a plain View, which we currently autogenerate using Python and manually edit and add to Snowflake.

He does not want us (DE team) to use DBT to do any transforming of RAW\_DATA. DBT is only for the Data Analyst team to use for creating models.

The main advantage I see to this approach is flexibility if the JSON schema changes. You can freely append/drop/insert/reorder/rename columns. whereas a normal table you can only drop, append, and rename.

On the downside, it is slow and clunky to parse with SQL and access the data as a view. It just seems inefficient to have to recompute the view and parse all those JSON payloads whenever you want to access the table.  
  
I'd much rather do the flattening in Python, either manually or using dlt. Some JSON payloads I 'pre-flatten' in Python to make them easier to parse in SQL.

Is there a better way, or is this how you all handle this as well?",6,1,fetus-flipper,2025-04-08 23:56:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jusby0/best_way_to_handle_loading_json_api_data_into/,0,False,2025-04-09 00:01:00,False,False,2025-04-08 23:56:12,23,Tuesday,272.0,1563,61.56,15,416,11.7,0,0

176,1jujn9j,Lessons from optimizing dashboard performance on Looker Studio with BigQuery data,"We’ve been using Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio) to build reporting dashboards for digital marketing and SEO data. At first, things worked fine—but as datasets grew, dashboard performance dropped significantly.



The biggest bottlenecks were:

• Overuse of blended data sources

• Direct querying of large GA4 datasets

• Too many calculated fields applied in the visualization layer



To fix this, we adjusted our approach on the data engineering side:

• Moved most calculations (e.g., conversion rates, ROAS) to the query layer in BigQuery

• Created materialized views for campaign-level summaries

• Used scheduled queries to pre-aggregate weekly and monthly data

• Limited Looker Studio to one direct connector per dashboard and cached data where possible



Result: dashboards now load in \~3 seconds instead of 15–20, and we can scale them across accounts with minimal changes.

177,1juhrrs,Help: Looking to set up a decent data architecture (data lake and/or warehouse),"Hi, I need help. I need a proper architecture for a department, and I am trying to get a data lake/warehouse.

Why: We have a lot of data sources from SaaS to manually created documents. We use a lot of SaaS products, but we have no centralised repository to store and stage the data, so we end up with a lot of workaround such as using SharePoint and csv stored in folders for reporting. We also change SaaS products quite frequently, so sources can change often. It is difficult to do advanced analytics. 

I prefer a lake & warehouse approach because (1) for SaaS users, they can can just drop the data to the lake and (2) transformation and processing can be done for reporting, and we could combine the datasets even when we change the SaaS software. 

My huge considerations are that (1) the data is to be accessible within the department only and (2) it has to be decent cost. Currently considered Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 & DataBricks, or Snowflake (to have both the lake and warehouse). My previous experience was only with Data Lake Storage Gen2.

I'm willing to work my way up for my technical limitations, but at this stage I am exploring the software solutions to get the buy in to kickstart this project.

180,1juvakz,Beginner Predictive Model Feedback/Guidance,"My predictive modeling folks, beginner here could use some feedback guidance. Go easy on me, this is my first machine learning/predictive model project and I had very basic python experience before this.


I’ve been working on a personal project building a model that predicts NFL player performance using full career, game-by-game data for any offensive player who logged a snap between 2017–2024. 

I trained the model using data through 2023 with XGBoost Regressor, and then used actual 2024 matchups — including player demographics (age, team, position, depth chart) and opponent defensive stats (Pass YPG, Rush YPG, Points Allowed, etc.) — as inputs to predict game-level performance in 2024.

The model performs really well for some stats (e.g., R² > 0.875 for Completions, Pass Attempts, CMP%, Pass Yards, and Passer Rating), but others — like Touchdowns, Fumbles, or Yards per Target — aren’t as strong.

Here’s where I need input:

-What’s a solid baseline R², RMSE, and MAE to aim for — and does that benchmark shift depending on the industry?

-Could trying other models/a combination of models improve the weaker stats? Should I use different models for different stat categories (e.g., XGBoost for high-R² ones, something else for low-R²)?

-How do you typically decide which model is the best fit? Trial and error? Is there a structured way to choose based on the stat being predicted?

-I used XGBRegressor based on common recommendations — are there variants of XGBoost or alternatives you'd suggest trying? Any others you like better?

-Are these considered “good” model results for sports data?

-Are sports models generally harder to predict than industries like retail, finance, or real estate?

-What should my next step be if I want to make this model more complete and reliable (more accurate) across all stat types?

-How do people generally feel about manually adding in more intangible stats to tweak data and model performance? Example: Adding an injury index/strength multiplier for a Defense that has a lot of injuries, or more player’s coming back from injury, etc.? Is this a generally accepted method or not really utilized?

182,1judm9f,GizmoSQL: Power your Enterprise analytics with Arrow Flight SQL and DuckDB,"Hi! This is Phil - Founder of [GizmoData](https://gizmodata.com). We have a new commercial database engine product called: [GizmoSQL](https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql) \- built with Apache Arrow Flight SQL (for remote connectivity) and DuckDB (or optionally: SQLite) as a back-end execution engine.

This product allows you to run DuckDB or SQLite as a server (remotely) - harnessing the power of computers in the cloud - which typically have more CPUs, more memory, and faster storage (NVMe) than your laptop. In fact, running GizmoSQL on a modern arm64-based VM in Azure, GCP, or AWS allows you to run at terabyte scale - with equivalent (or better) performance - for a fraction of the cost of other popular platforms such as Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks SQL.

**GizmoSQL** is self-hosted (for now) - with a possible SaaS offering in the near future. It has these features to differentiate it from ""base"" DuckDB:

* Run DuckDB or SQLite as a server (remote connectivity)
* Concurrency - allows multiple users to work simultaneously - with independent, ACID-compliant sessions
* Security
   * Authentication
   * TLS for encryption of traffic to/from the database
* Static executable with Arrow Flight SQL, DuckDB, SQLite, and JWT-CPP built-in. There are no dependencies to install - just a single executable file to run
* Free for use in development, evaluation, and testing
* Easily containerized for running in the Cloud - especially in Kubernetes
* Easy to talk to - with ADBC, JDBC, and ODBC drivers, and now a Websocket proxy server (created by GizmoData) - so it is easy to use with javascript frameworks
   * Use it with Tableau, PowerBI, Apache Superset dashboards, and more
* Easy to work with in Python - use ADBC, or the new experimental Ibis back-end - details here: [https://github.com/gizmodata/ibis-gizmosql](https://github.com/gizmodata/ibis-gizmosql)

Because it is powered by DuckDB - GizmoSQL can work with the popular open-source data formats - such as Iceberg, Delta Lake, Parquet, and more.

GizmoSQL performs very well (when running DuckDB as its back-end execution engine) - check out our graph comparing popular SQL engines for TPC-H at scale-factor 1 Terabyte - on the homepage at: [https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql](https://gizmodata.com/gizmosql) \- there you will find it also costs far less than other options.

We would love to get your feedback on the software - it is easy to get started for free in two different ways:

* For a limited time - try GizmoSQL online on our dime - with the SQL Query Navigator - it just requires a quick registration and sign-in to get going - at: [https://app.gizmodata.com](https://app.gizmodata.com) \- where we have a read-only 1TB TPC-H database mounted for you to query in real-time. It is running on an Azure Cobalt 100 VM - with local NVMe SSD's - so it should be quite zippy.
* Download and self-host GizmoSQL - using our Docker image or executables for Linux and macOS for both x86-64 and arm64 architectures. See our README at: [https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql-public](https://github.com/gizmodata/gizmosql-public) for details on how to easily and quickly get started that way

Thank you for taking a look at GizmoSQL. We are excited and are glad to answer any questions you may have!

Pros: No need to store data in clickhouse as it can just proxy it directly from MySQL.

Cons: This however puts extra reads on MySQL and doesn't help us if MySQL ever goes down. 

2. Use signals to send the data to clickhouse whenever there is a change in MySQL.

Pros: We don't have a lot of tables currently so it's the quickest to setup. 

Cons: Extremely inefficient and not scalable. 

3. Use some sort of third party sink to achieve this. I have found this https://github.com/Altinity/clickhouse-sink-connector which seems to do the job but it has way too many open issues and not sure if it is reliable enough. Plus, it complicates our tech stack which we are looking not to do. 

I'm open to any other ideas. We would ideally not want to duplicate this data in clickhouse but if that's the last resort we would go for it. 

Thanks in advance. 

P.S, I am a beginner in data engineering so feel free to correct me if I've used some wrong jargons or if I am seriously deviating from the right path.

187,1juj0x6,Beginning Data Scientist in Azure needing some help (iot),"Hi all,

I currently am working on a new structure to save sensor data coming from Azure Iot Hub in Azure to store it into Azure Blob Storage for historical data, and Clickhouse for hot data with TTL (around half year). The sensor data is coming from different entities (e.g building1, boat1, boat2) and should be partioned by entity. The data we’re processing daily is around 300-2 million records per day.

I know Azure Iot Hub is essentially a built-in Azure Hub. I had a few questions since I’ve tried multiple solutions. 

1. Normal message routing to Azure Blob
Issue: no custom partitioning on file structure (e.g entityid/timestamp_sensor/) it requires you to use the enqueued time. And there is no dead letter queue for fallback

2. IoT hub -> Azure Functions -> Blob Storage & Clickhouse
Issue: this should work correctly but I have not that much experience in Azure Functions, I tried creating a function with the IoT Hub template but it seems I need to also have an Event Hubs namespace which is not what I want. HTTP trigger is also not what I want. I don’t find any good documentation on it aswell. I know I can maybe use Event Hubs trigger and use the Iot Hub connection string but I didn’t manage to do this yet.

3. IoT hub -> Event Grid 
Someone suggested using Event Grid, however to my knowledge Event Grid is not used for telemetry data despite there being an option for. Is this beneficial? I don’t really know what the flow would be since you can’t use Event Grid to send data to Clickhouse. You would still need an Azure Functions.

4. IoT Hub -> Event Grid -> Event Hubs -> Azure Functions -> Azure Blob & Clickhouse
This one seemed the most appealing to me but I don’t know if it’s the smartest, it can get expensive (maybe).
But the idea here is that we use Event Grid for batching the data and to have a dead letter queue.
Arrived in Event Hubs we use an Azure Function to send the data to blob storage and clickhouse.

The only problem is I might need some delay to sending to Clickhouse & Blob Storage (around maybe every 15 minutes) to reduce the risks of memory usage in Clickhouse and to reduce costs.

Can someone help me out? Am I forgetting something crucial? I am a graduated data scientist, however I have no in depth experience with Azure.

We're building ETL pipelines, using Airflow in one K8s namespace and Spark in another (the latter having dedicated hardware). Most data workloads aren't really Spark-worthy as files are typically <20GB, and we keep hitting pain points where processes struggle in Airflow's memory (workers are 6Gi and 6 CPU, with a limit of 10GI; no KEDA or HPA). We are looking into more efficient data structures like DuckDB, Polars, etc or running ""mid-tier"" processes as separate K8s jobs but then we hit constraints like tools/libraries relying on Pandas use so we seem stuck with eager processes.

Case in point, I just learned that our teams are having to split files into smaller files of 125k records so Pydantic schema validation won't fail on memory. I looked into GX Core and see the main source options there again appear to be Pandas or Spark dataframes (yes, I'm going to try DuckDB through SQLAlchemy). I could bite the bullet and just say to go with Spark, but then our pipelines will be using Spark for QA and not for ETL which will be fun to keep clarifying.

I don’t have any indication also of when something is finished. For example, it’s highly possible to have 100 files that would end up being 100% of my daily table, but I receive them scattered over 15min-30 when the data become available and my ingestion process ingest it. Can be 1 to 12 hours after the day is over.

Not that’s it’s also possible to have 10000 very small files per day.

I’m wondering how is this solves with Iceberg tables. Very newbie Iceberg guy here. Like I don’t see throughput write benchmark anywhere but I figure that rewriting the metadata files must be a big overhead if there’s a very large amount of files so inserting every times there’s a new one must not be the ideal solution.

I’ve read some medium post saying that there was a snapshot feature which track new files so you don’t have to do some fancy things to load them incrementally. But again if every insert is a query that change the metadata files it must be bad at some point.

Do you wait and usually build a process to store a list of files before inserting them or is this a feature build somewhere already in a doc I can’t find ?

Any help would be appreciated.

I want to keep preparing for interviews on the side, and to do that I need to know which role to aim for. 

Pros of SWE:
- more jobs positions 
- I have already invested 300 hours into DSA Leetcode. Don’t have to start DE prep from scratch
-Maybe better quality of work/pay(?)

Pros of DE:
- targeting a niche has always given me more callbacks
- if I practice a lot of sql, the interviews at FAANG could be gamed. FAANG do ask DSA but they barely scratch the surface

My thoughts:
Ideally I want to crack the SWE role at a FAANG as I like both roles equally but SWE pays 20% more. If I don’t get callbacks for SWE, then securing a similar pay through a DE role at FAANG is lucrative too. 
I’d be completely fine with doing DE, but I feel uneasy wasting the 100s of hours I spent on DSA. 

Applying for both jobs is sub optimal as I can only sink my time into SQL or DSA | system design or data modelling.

We're currently running into scaling issues with our in-house data catalog and I think we need something more robust for governance and lineage tracking.

I've narrowed it down to Acryl (DataHub) and Collate (openmetadata) as the main contenders. I know I should look at Collibra and Alation and maybe Unity Catalog?

For context, we're a mid-sized fintech (\~500 employees) with about 30 data engineers and scientists. We're AWS with Snowflake, Airflow for orchestration, and a growing number of ML models in production.

My question list is: 

1. How these tools handle machine-scale operations 
2. How painful was it to get set up?
3. For DataHub and openmetadata specifically - is the open source version viable or is the cloud version necessary?
4. Any unexpected limitations you've hit with any of these platforms?
5. Do you feel like these grow with you as we increasingly head into AI governance? 
6. How well they integrate with existing tools (Snowflake, dbt, Looker, etc.)

We're building ETL pipelines, using Airflow in one K8s namespace and Spark in another (the latter having dedicated hardware). Most data workloads aren't really Spark-worthy as files are typically <20GB, and we keep hitting pain points where processes struggle in Airflow's memory (workers are 6Gi and 6 CPU, with a limit of 10GI; no KEDA or HPA). We are looking into more efficient data structures like DuckDB, Polars, etc or running ""mid-tier"" processes as separate K8s jobs but then we hit constraints like tools/libraries relying on Pandas use so we seem stuck with eager processes.

Case in point, I just learned that our teams are having to split files into smaller files of 125k records so Pydantic schema validation won't fail on memory. I looked into GX Core and see the main source options there again appear to be Pandas or Spark dataframes (yes, I'm going to try DuckDB through SQLAlchemy). I could bite the bullet and just say to go with Spark, but then our pipelines will be using Spark for QA and not for ETL which will be fun to keep clarifying.

Can be 1 to 12 hours after the day is over.

Not that’s it’s also possible to have 10000 very small files per day.

I’m wondering how is this solves with Iceberg tables. Very newbie Iceberg guy here. Like I don’t see throughput write benchmark anywhere but I figure that rewriting the metadata files must be a big overhead if there’s a very large amount of files so inserting every times there’s a new one must not be the ideal solution.

I’ve read some medium post saying that there was a snapshot feature which track new files so you don’t have to do some fancy things to load them incrementally. But again if every insert is a query that change the metadata files it must be bad at some point.

Do you wait and usually build a process to store a list of files before inserting them or is this a feature build somewhere already in a doc I can’t find ?

Any help would be appreciated.

But how do you deal with a legacy data lake where there's been years of data written into tables with no changes to original source-defined schemas?

How do you tackle such a legacy mess of data? Say I want to create a Kimball model that models a persons fact table as the grain, and dimensions tables for biographical and employment data. Is my only choice to just manually inspect all the different tables to find which have the kind of column I need? Note here that there wasn't even a basic normalisation of column names enforced (""phone_num"", ""phone"", ""tel"", ""phone_number"" etc) and some of this data is already in OBT form with some containing up to a hundred sparsely populated columns.

Do I apply fuzzy matching to identify source columns? Use an LLM to build massive mapping dictionaries? What are some approaches or methods I should consider when tackling this so I'm not stuck scrolling through infinite print outs? There is a metadata catalogue with some columns having been given tags to identify its content, but these aren't consistent and also have high cardinality.

From the business perspective, they want completeness, so I can't strategically pick which tables to use and ignore the rest. Is there a way I should prioritize based on integrating the largest datasets first?

220,1jy7sii,Building a Real-Time Analytics Pipeline: Balancing Throughput and Latency,"Hey everyone,

I'm designing a system to process and analyze a continuous stream of data with a focus on both high throughput and low latency. I wanted to share my proposed architecture and get your insights.

1. The core components are: **Kafka:** Serving as the central nervous system for ingesting a massive amount of data reliably.
2. **Go Processor:** A consumer application written in Go, placed directly after Kafka, to perform initial, low-latency processing and filtering of the incoming data.
3. **Intermediate Queue (Redis Streams/NATS JetStream):** To decouple the low-latency processing from the potentially slower analytics and to provide buffering for data that needs further analysis.
4. **Analytics Consumer:** Responsible for the more intensive analytical tasks on the filtered data from the queue.
5. **WebSockets:** For pushing the processed insights to a frontend in real-time.

The idea is to leverage Kafka's throughput capabilities while using Go for quick initial processing. The queue acts as a buffer and allows us to be selective about the data sent for deeper analytics. Finally, WebSockets provide the real-time link to the user.

I built this keeping in mind these three principles

* **Separation of Concerns:** Each component has a specific responsibility.
* **Scalability:** Kafka handles ingestion, and individual consumers can be scaled independently.
* **Resilience:** The queue helps decouple processing stages.

Has anyone implemented a similar architecture? What were some of the challenges and lessons learned? Any recommendations for improvements or alternative approaches?

How does local testing happen?

**->** if we will use glue's compute engine we run into the first question of: gap between code base and single jobs.

**->** if we use open source spark locally:

1. data can be too big to be processed locally, even if we are just testing, and this might be the reason we opted for serverless spark on the first place.

We're currently running into scaling issues with our in-house data catalog and I think we need something more robust for governance and lineage tracking.

I've narrowed it down to Acryl (DataHub) and Collate (openmetadata) as the main contenders. I know I should look at Collibra and Alation and maybe Unity Catalog?

For context, we're a mid-sized fintech (\~500 employees) with about 30 data engineers and scientists. We're AWS with Snowflake, Airflow for orchestration, and a growing number of ML models in production.

1. The data extraction is done using a python script using bcp command and pyodbc library 
2. The converted code from snowconvert will be used in a python script again to create all the database objects. 
3. data extracted will be loaded into internal stage and then to table 

2 and 3 will use snowflake’s python connector

1. Use ADF to store pipeline output into an Azure blob container 
2. Use external stage to utilise this blob and load data into table

2. Is there a free way to handle this transitional data as well. It needs to be enterprise level (Also what is wrong with using VS Code extension)

233,1jysxtk,Why Data Warehouses Were Created?,"The original data chaos actually started *before* spreadsheets were common. In the pre-ERP days, most business systems were siloed—HR, finance, sales, you name it—all running on their own. To report on anything meaningful, you had to extract data from each system, often manually. These extracts were pulled at different times, using different rules, and then stitched togethe. The result? Data quality issues. And to make matters worse, people were running these reports directly against transactional databases—systems that were supposed to be optimized for speed and reliability, not analytics. The reporting load bogged them down.

The problem was so painful for the businesses, so around the late 1980s, a few forward-thinking folks—most famously Bill Inmon—proposed a better way: a data warehouse.

To make matter even worse, in the late ’00s every department had its own spreadsheet empire. Finance had one version of “the truth,” Sales had another, and Marketing were inventing their own metrics. People would walk into meetings with totally different numbers for the same KPI.

The spreadsheet party had turned into a data chaos rave. There was no lineage, no source of truth—just lots of tab-switching and passive-aggressive email threads. It wasn’t just annoying—it was a risk. Businesses were making big calls on bad data. So data warehousing became common practice!

237,1jyve41,Event Sourcing as a creative tool for developers,"Hey, I think there are better use cases for event sourcing.  
  
Event sourcing is an architecture where you capture every change in your system as an immutable event, rather than just storing the latest state. Instead of only knowing what your data looks like now, you keep a full history of how it got there. In a simple crud app that would mean that every deleted, updated, and created entry is stored in your event source, that way when you replay your events you can recreate the state that the application was in at any given time.

Most developers see event sourcing as a kind of technical safety net: - Recovering from failures - Rebuilding corrupted read models - Auditability

Surviving schema changes without too much pain

And fair enough, replaying your event stream often feels like a stressful situation. Something broke, you need to fix it, and you’re crossing your fingers hoping everything rebuilds cleanly.

What if replaying your event history wasn’t just for emergencies? What if it was a normal, everyday part of building your system?

Instead of treating replay as a recovery mechanism, you treat it as a development tool — something you use to evolve your data models, improve your logic, and shape new views of your data over time. More excitingly, it means you can derive entirely new schemas from your event history whenever your needs change.

Your database stops being the single source of truth and instead becomes what it was always meant to be: a fast, convenient cache for your data, not the place where all your logic and assumptions are locked in.

With a full event history, you’re free to experiment with new read models, adapt your data structures without fear, and shape your data exactly to fit new purposes — like enriching fields, backfilling values, or building dedicated models for AI consumption. Replay becomes not about fixing what broke, but about continuously improving what you’ve built.

And this has big implications — especially when it comes to AI and MCP Servers.

Most application databases aren’t built for natural language querying or AI-powered insights. Their schemas are designed for transactions, not for understanding. Data is spread across normalized tables, with relationships and assumptions baked deeply into the structure.

But when you treat your event history as the source of truth, you can replay your events into purpose-built read models, specifically structured for AI consumption.

Need flat, denormalized tables for efficient semantic search? Done. Want to create a user-centric view with pre-joined context for better prompts? Easy. You’re no longer limited by your application’s schema — you shape your data to fit exactly how your AI needs to consume it.

And here’s where it gets really interesting: AI itself can help you explore your data history and discover what’s valuable.

Instead of guessing which fields to include, you can use AI to interrogate your raw events, spot gaps, surface patterns, and guide you in designing smarter read models. It’s a feedback loop: your AI doesn’t just query your data — it helps you shape it.

So instead of forcing your AI to wrestle with your transactional tables, you give it clean, dedicated models optimized for discovery, reasoning, and insight.

And the best part? You can keep iterating. As your AI use cases evolve, you simply adjust your flows and replay your events to reshape your models — no migrations, no backfills, no re-engineering.",14,11,No-Exam2934,2025-04-14 10:15:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jyve41/event_sourcing_as_a_creative_tool_for_developers/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-14 10:15:58,10,Monday,570.0,3470,51.18,28,893,12.7,0,0
238,1jyxdlb,ETL for Ingesting S3 files and converting to Iceberg,"So, I'm currently working on a project (my first) to create a scalable data platform for a company. The whole thing structured around AWS, initially using DMS to migrate PostgreSQL data to S3 in parquet format (this is our raw datalake). Then using Glue jobs to read this data and create Iceberg tables which would be used in Athena queries and Quicksight. I've got a working Glue script for reading this data and perform upsert operations. Okay so now that I've given a bit of context of what I'm trying to do, let me tell you my problem.  
The client wants me to schedule this job to run every 15min or so for staging and most probably every hour for production. The data in the raw datalake is partitioned by date (for example: s3bucket/table\_name/2025/04/10/file.parquet). Now that I have to run this job every 15 min or so I'm not sure how to keep track of the files that have been processed and which haven't. Currently my script finds the current time and modifies the read command to use just the folder for the current date. But still, this means that I'll be reading all the files in the folder (processed already or not) every time the job runs during the day.   
I've looked around and found that using DynamoDB for keeping track of the files would be my best option but also found something related to Iceberg metadata files that could help me with this. I'm leaning towards the Iceberg option as I wanna make use of all its features but have too little information regarding this to implement. would absolutely appreciate it if someone could help me out with this.

239,1jytkai,Need Advice on solution - Mapping Inconsistent Country Names to Standardized Values,"Hi Folks,

In my current project, we are ingesting a wide variety of external public datasets. One common issue we’re facing is that the **country names in these datasets are not standardized**. For example, we may encounter entries like **""Burma"" instead of ""Myanmar""**, or **""Islamic Republic of Iran"" instead of ""Iran""**.

My initial approach was to extract all unique country name variations and map them to a list of standard country names using logic such as CASE WHEN conditions or basic string-matching techniques.

However, my manager has suggested we leverage **AI/LLM-based models** to automate the mapping of these country names to a standardized list to handle new query points as well. 

I have a couple of concerns and would appreciate your thoughts:

1. **Is using AI/LLMs a suitable approach for this problem?**
2. **Can LLMs be fully reliable in these mappings, or is there a risk of incorrect matches?**
3. I was considering implementing a **feedback pipeline** that highlights any newly encountered or unmapped country names during data ingestion so we can review and incorporate logic to handle them in the code over time. Would this be a better or complementary solution?
4. Please suggest if there is some better approach.

I’d like to ask for your advice on designing a relational data warehouse fed from our ERP system. We plan to use Power BI as our reporting tool, and all departments in the company will rely on it for analytics.

The challenge is that teams from different departments expect **the data to be fully related and ready** to use when building dashboards, minimizing the need for additional modeling. We’re struggling to determine the best approach to meet these expectations.

What would you recommend?

Should all dimensions and facts be pre-related in the data warehouse, even if it adds complexity?

Creating separate data models in Power BI for different departments/use cases?

Handling all relationships in the data warehouse and exposing them via curated datasets?

Should we empower Power BI users to create their own data models, or enforce strict governance with documented relationships?

257,1jyv9wq,One of the best Fivetran alternative,"If you're urgently looking for a Fivetran alternative, this might help

Been seeing a lot of people here caught off guard by the new Fivetran pricing. If you're in eCommerce and relying on platforms like Shopify, Amazon, TikTok, or Walmart, the shift to MAR-based billing makes things really hard to predict and for a lot of teams, hard to justify.

If you’re in that boat and actively looking for alternatives, this might be helpful.

**Daton**, built by Saras Analytics, is an ETL tool specifically created for eCommerce. That focus has made a big difference for a lot of teams we’ve worked with recently who needed something that aligns better with how eComm brands operate and grow.

Here are a few reasons teams are choosing it when moving off Fivetran:

**Flat, predictable pricing**  
There’s no MAR billing. You’re not getting charged more just because your campaigns performed well or your syncs ran more often. Pricing is clear and stable, which helps a lot for brands trying to manage budgets while scaling.

**Retail-first coverage**  
Daton supports all the platforms most eComm teams rely on. Amazon, Walmart, Shopify, TikTok, Klaviyo and more are covered with production-grade connectors and logic that understands how retail data actually works.

**Built-in reporting**  
Along with pipelines, Daton includes Pulse, a reporting layer with dashboards and pre-modeled metrics like CAC, LTV, ROAS, and SKU performance. This means you can skip the BI setup phase and get straight to insights.

**Custom connectors without custom pricing**  
If you use a platform that’s not already integrated, the team will build it for you. No surprise fees. They also take care of API updates so your pipelines keep running without extra effort.

**Support that’s actually helpful**  
You’re not stuck waiting in a ticket queue. Teams get hands-on onboarding and responsive support, which is a big deal when you’re trying to migrate pipelines quickly and with minimal friction.

Most eComm brands start with a stack of tools. Shopify for the storefront, a few ad platforms, email, CRM, and so on. Over time, that stack evolves. You might switch CRMs, change ad platforms, or add new tools. But Shopify stays. It grows with you. Daton is designed with the same mindset. You shouldn't have to rethink your data infrastructure every time your business changes. It’s built to scale with your brand.

If you're currently evaluating options or trying to avoid a painful renewal, Daton might be worth looking into. I work with the Saras team and happy to help , here's the link if you want to checkout [https://www.sarasanalytics.com/saras-daton](https://www.sarasanalytics.com/saras-daton)

I have a dataset of company owned products like: Name: Company A, Address: 5th avenue, Product: A. 
Company A inc, Address: New york, Product B. 
Company A inc. , Address, 5th avenue New York, product C. 

I have 400 million entries like these. As you can see, addresses and names are in inconsistent formats. 
I have another dataset that will be me ground truth for companies. It has a clean name for the company along with it’s parsed address. 

The objective is to match the records from the table with inconsistent formats to the ground truth, so that each product is linked to a clean company. 



Questions and help: 
- i was thinking to use google geocoding api to parse the addresses and get geocoding. Then use the geocoding to perform distance search between my my addresses and ground truth BUT i don’t have the geocoding in the ground truth dataset. So, i would like to find another method to match parsed addresses without using geocoding. 

- Ideally, i would like to be able to input my parsed address and the name (maybe along with some other features like industry of activity) and get returned the top matching candidates from the ground truth dataset with a score between 0 and 1. Which approach would you suggest that fits big size datasets? 

- The method should be able to handle cases were one of my addresses could be: company A, address: Washington (meaning an approximate address that is just a city for example, sometimes the country is not even specified). I will receive several parsed addresses from this candidate as Washington is vague. What is the best practice in such cases? As the google api won’t return a single result, what can i do?

- My addresses are from all around the world, do you know if google api can handle the whole world? Would a language model be better at parsing for some regions? 

Help would be very much appreciated, thank you guys.

266,1jzyxdw,How would you handle the ingestion of thousands of files ?,"Hello,
I’m facing a philosophical question at work and I can’t find an answer that would put my brain at ease. 

Basically we work with Databricks and Pyspark for ingestion and transformation.

We have a new data provider that sends crypted and zipped files to an s3 bucket. There are a couple of thousands of files (2 years of historic).

We wanted to use dataloader from databricks. It’s basically a spark stream that scans folders, finds the files that you never ingested (it keeps track in a table) and reads the new files only and write them.
The problem is that dataloader doesn’t handle encrypted and zipped files (json files inside).

We can’t unzip files permanently. 

My coworker proposed that we use the autoloader to find the files (that it can do) and in that spark stream use the for each batch method to apply a lambda that does:
- get the file name (current row)
-decrypt and unzip
-hash the files (to avoid duplicates in case of failure)
-open the unzipped file using spark
-save in the final table using spark 

I argued that it’s not the right place to do all that and since it’s not the use case of autoloader it’s not a good practice, he argues that spark is distributed and that’s the only thing we care since it allows us to do what we need quickly even though it’s hard to debug (and we need to pass the s3 credentials to each executor using the lambda…)

I proposed a homemade solution which isn’t the most optimal, but it seems better and easier to maintain which is:
- use boto paginator to find files
- decrypt and unzip each file 
- write then json in the team bucket/folder
-create a monitoring table in which we save the file name, hash, status (ok/ko) and exceptions if there are any

He argues that this is not efficient since it’ll only use one single node cluster and not parallelised. 

I never encountered such use case before and I’m kind of stuck, I read a lot of literature but everything seems very generic. 

Edit: we only receive 2 to 3 files daily per data feed (150mo per file on average) but we have 2 years of historical data which amounts to around 1000 files. So we need 1 run for all the historic then a daily run. 
Every feed ingested is a class instantiation (a job on a cluster with a config) so it doesn’t matter if we have 10 feeds. 

Edit2: 1000 files roughly summed to 130go after unzipping. Not sure of average zip/json file though. 

What do you people think of this? Any advices ?

I though this makes no sense since it would result in extreme redudancy : you would have multiple minute rows for a single day for example. 

Now I am questioning my skills as he is a specialist and teorically knows better. I am failing to understand how a single timestamp table is better than seperates time and date dimentions",1,7,mrkatatau,2025-04-15 22:39:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k05837/how_do_you_handle_datetime_dimentions/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-15 22:39:58,22,Tuesday,154.0,883,56.05,10,239,11.6,0,0
281,1k00qv1,Best setup report builder within SaaS?,"Hi everyone,

We've built a CRM and are looking to implement a report builder in our app.

We are exploring the best solutions for our needs and it seems like we have two paths we could take:

* Option A: Build the front-end/query builder ourselves and hit read-only replica
* Option B: Build the front-end/query builder ourselves and hit a data warehouse we've built using a key-base replication mechanism on BigQuery/Snowflake, etc..
* Option C: Use third party tools like Explo etc...

About the app:

* Our stack is React, Rails, Postgres.
* Our most used table (contacts) have 20,000,000 rows
* Some of our users have custom fields

We're trying to build something scalable but most importantly not spend months in this project.  
As a result, I'm wondering about the viability of Option A vs. Option B.  
  
One important point is how to manage custom fields that our users created on some objects.

We were thinking about, for contacts for example, we were thinking about simply running with joins across the following tables

* contacts
* contacts\_custom\_fields
* companies (and any other related 1:1 table so we can query fields from related 1:1 objects)
* contacts\_calculated\_fields (materialized view to compute values from 1:many relationship like # of deals the contacts is on)

So the two questions are:

* Would managing all this on the read-only be viable for our volume and a good starting point or will we hit the performance limits soon given our volume?
* Is managing custom fields this way the right way?",1,2,birdshine7,2025-04-15 19:28:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1k00qv1/best_setup_report_builder_within_saas/,0,False,False,False,False,2025-04-15 19:28:35,19,Tuesday,257.0,1529,43.97,9,401,14.7,0,0

284,1jzzf00,My Experience in preparing Azure Data Engineer Associate DP-203.,"So I recently appeared for the DP-203 certification by Microsoft and want to share my learnings and strategy that I followed to crack the exam.

As you all must already be knowing that this exam is labelled as “**Intermediate**” by Microsoft themselves which is perfect in my opinion. This exam does test you in the various concepts that are required for a data engineer to  master in his/her career. 

Having said that, it is not too hard to crack the exam but at the same time also not as easy as appearing for AZ-900. 

DP-203 is aimed at testing the understanding of data related concepts and various tools Microsoft has offered in its suite to make your life easier. Some topics include SQL, Modern Data Warehousing, Python, PySpark, Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure EventHubs, Azure Data Lake Storage and last but not the least Azure Databricks. You can go through the complete set of topics this exam focuses on here - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer/?practice-assessment-type=certification#certification-take-the-exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer/?practice-assessment-type=certification#certification-take-the-exam)



**Courses:**

I had just taken this one course for DP-203 by Alan Rodrigues *(This is not a paid promotion. I just thought that these resources were good to refer to)* and this is a 24 hour long course which has covered all the important and core concepts clearly and precisely. What I loved the most about this course is that it is a complete hands-on course. One more thing is that the instructor very rarely mentions anything as “this has already been covered in the previous sections”. If there is anything that we are using in the current section he makes sure to give a quick background on what has been covered in the earlier sections. Why this is so important is because we tend to forget some things and by just getting a refresher in a couple of sentences we are up to speed. 

For those of you who don’t know, Microsoft offers access to majority resources if not all for FREE credit worth $200 for 30 days. So you simply have to sign up on their portal (insert link) and get access to all of them for 30 days. If you are residing in another country then convert dollars to your local currency. That is how much worth of free credit you will get for 30 days. 

**For example -** 

I live in India. 

1 $ = 87.789 INR 

So I got FREE credits worth 87.789 X 200 = Rs 17,557

Even when I appeared for the exam (Feb 8th, 2025) I hardly got 3-4 questions from the mock tests. But don’t get disheartened. Be sure you are consistent with your learning path and take notes whenever required. As I mentioned earlier, the exam is not very hard.

**Mock Tests Resources:**

So I had referred a couple of resources for taking the mocks which I have mentioned below. *(This is not a paid promotion. I just thought that these resources were good to refer to.)*



1. **Udemy Practice Tests -** [https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-microsoft-azure-dp-203-data-engineering/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING](https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-microsoft-azure-dp-203-data-engineering/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING)
2. **Microsoft Practice Assessments -** [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=49&practice-assessment-type=certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=49&practice-assessment-type=certification)
3. [https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/dp-203/](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/dp-203/)





**DO’s:**



1. Make sure that if and whenever possible you do hands-on for all the sections and videos that have been covered in the Udemy course as I am 100% sure that you will encounter certain errors and would have to explore and solve the errors by yourself. This will build a sense of confidence and achievement after being able to run the pipelines or code all by yourself. (Also don’t forget to delete or pause resources whenever needed so that you get a hang of it and don’t lose out on money. The instructor does tell you when to do so.)
2. Let’s be very practical, nobody remembers all the resolutions or solutions to every single issue or problem faced in the past. We tend to forget things over time and hence it is very important to document everything that you think is useful and would be important in the future. Maintain an excel sheet and create two columns “**Errors” and “Learnings/Resolution**” so that next time you encounter the same issue you already have a solution and don’t waste time. 
3. Watch and practice at least 5-10 videos daily. This way you can complete all the videos in a month and then go back and rewatch lessons you thought were hard. Then you can start giving practice tests. 





**DON'Ts:**



1. By heart all the MCQs or answers to the questions. 
2. Refer to many resources so much so that you will get overwhelmed and not be able to focus on preparation.
3. Even refer to multiple courses from different websites.





**Conclusion:**

All in all, just make sure you do your hands on, practice regularly, give a timeline for yourself, don’t mug up things, don’t by heart things, make sure you use limited but quality resources for learning and practice. I am sure that by following these things you will be able to crack the exam in the first attempt itself.

286,1jzunnw,"bigquery/sheet/tableau, need for advice","Hello everyone,

I recently joined a project that uses BigQuery for data storage, dbt for transformations, and Tableau for dashboarding. I'd like some advice on improving our current setup.

# Current Architecture

* Data pipelines run transformations using dbt
* Data from BigQuery is synchronized to Google Sheets
* Tableau reports connect to these Google Sheets (not directly to BigQuery)
* Users can modify tracking values directly in Google Sheets

# The Problems

1. **Manual Process**: Currently, the Google Sheets and Tableau connections are created manually during development
2. **Authentication Issues**: In development, Tableau connects using the individual developer's account credentials
3. **Orchestration Concerns**: We have Google Cloud Composer for orchestration, but the Google Sheets synchronization happens separately

# Questions

1. What's the best way to automate the creation and configuration of Google Sheets in this workflow? Is there a Terraform approach or another IaC solution?
2. How should we properly manage connection strings in tableau between environments, especially when moving from development (using personal accounts) to production?

I also notice that I get very random books that are not at all on topic for what I specific with my query parameters. e.g. title='data' and author=' '. 

  
I am wondering if anybody knows how to get only relevant data with API calls, as well as non duplicate value with each run of the script (eg persistent pagination).

I have to migrate at the end almost trillions volumes of data into a postgres DB wherein CRUD operations can be run most efficiently. The data present is in the form of a many to many relationship. How the data looks is:  
  
In my old data base i have a value T1 which is connected to on average 700 values (like x1,x2,x3...x700). Here in the old DB we are saving 700 records of this connection. Similarly other values like T2,T3,T100 all have multiple connections each having a separate row

Use case:  
We need to make updates,deletions and inserts to both values of T and values of X  
for example,  
I am given That value T1 instead of 700 connections of X has now 800 connections...so i must update or insert all the new connections corresponding to T1  
And like wise if I am given , we need to update all T values X1 (say X1 has 200 connection of T) i need to insert/update or delete T values associated with X1.

  
for now, I was thinking of aggregating my data in the form of a jsonb column  
where  
Column T             Column X (jsonb)  
T1                           {""value"":\[X1,X2,X3.....X700\]}

But i will have to create another similar table where i keep column T as jsonb. Since any updates in one table needs to be synced to the other any errors may cause it to be out of sync.

Also the time taken to read and update a jsonb row will be high

291,1jzvfys,"Event sourcing isn’t about storing history. it’s about replaying it.
Discussion","Replay isn’t just about fixing broken systems. It’s about rethinking how we build them in the first place. If your data architecture is driven by immutable events instead of current state, then replay stops being a recovery mechanism and starts becoming a way to continuously reshape, refine, and evolve your system with zero fear of breaking things.

Let’s talk about replay :)

**Event sourcing is misunderstood**  
For most developers, event sourcing shows up as a safety mechanism. It’s there to recover from a failure, rebuild a read model, trace an audit trail, or get through a schema change without too much pain. Replay is something you reach for in the rare cases when things go sideways.

That’s how it’s typically treated. A fallback. Something reactive.

But that lens is narrow. It frames replay as an emergency tool instead of something more fundamental. When events are treated as the source of truth, replay can become a normal, repeatable part of development. Not just a way to recover, but a way to refine.

**What if replay wasn’t just for emergencies?**  
What if it was a routine, even joyful, part of building your system?

Instead of treating replay as a recovery mechanism, you treat it as a development tool. Something you use to evolve your data models, improve your business logic, and shape entirely new views of your data over time. And more excitingly, it means you can derive entirely new schemas from your event history whenever your needs change.

**Why replay is so hard in most setups**  
Here’s the catch. In most event-sourced systems, **events are emitted after your app logic runs**. Your API gets the request, updates the database, and only then emits a change event. That event is a side effect, not the source of truth.

So when you want to replay, it gets tricky. You need replay-safe logic. You need to carefully version events. You need infrastructure to reprocess historical data. And you have to make absolutely sure you’re not double-applying anything.

That’s why replay often feels fragile. It’s not that the idea is bad. It’s just hard to pull off.

**But what if you flip the model?**  
What if events come first, not last?

That’s the approach we took.

A user action, like creating a user, updating an address, or assigning a tag, sends an event. That event is immediately appended to an immutable event store, **and only then** is it passed along to the application API to validate and store in the database.

Suddenly your database isn’t your source of truth. It’s just a read model. A fast, disposable output of your event stream.

So when you want to evolve your logic or reshape your data structure, all you have to do is update your flow, delete the old database, and press replay.

That’s it.

No migrations.  
No fragile ETL jobs.  
No one-off backfills.  
Just replay your history into the new shape.

**Your data becomes fluid**  
Say you’re running an e-commerce platform, and six months in, you realize you never tracked the discount code a customer used at checkout. It wasn’t part of the original schema. Normally, this would mean a migration, a painful manual backfill (if the data even still exists), or writing a fragile script to stitch it in later, assuming you’re lucky enough to recover it.

But with a full event history, you don’t need to hack anything.

You just update your flow logic to extract the discount code from the original checkout events. Then replay them.

Within minutes, your entire dataset is updated. The new field is populated everywhere it should have been, as if it had been there from day one.

**Your database becomes what it was always meant to be**  
A cache.  
Not a source of truth.  
Something you can throw away and rebuild without fear.  
You stop treating your schema like a delicate glass sculpture and start treating it like software.

**Replay unlocks AI-native data (with MCP Servers)**  
Most application databases are optimized for transactions, not understanding. They’re normalized, rigid, and shaped around application logic, not meaning. That’s fine for serving an app. But for AI? Nope.

Language models thrive on context. They need denormalized, readable structures. They need relationships spelled out. They need the why, not just the what.

When you have an event history, not just state but actions and intent. You can replay those events into entirely new shapes. You can build read models that are tailored specifically for AI: flattened tables for semantic search, user-centric structures for chat interfaces, agent-friendly layouts for reasoning.

And it’s not just one-and-done. You can reshape your models over and over as your use cases evolve. No migrations. No backfills. Just a new flow and a replay.

What is even more interesting is that with the help of MCP Servers AI can help you do this. By interrogating the event history with natural language prompts, it can suggest new model structures, flag gaps, and uncover meaning you didn’t plan for. It’s a feedback loop: replay helps AI make sense of your data, and AI helps you decide how to replay.

And none of this works without events that store intent. Current state is just a snapshot. Events tell the story.

**So, why doesn’t everyone build this way?**  
Because it’s hard. You need immutable storage. Replay-safe logic. Tools to build and maintain read models. Schema evolution support. Observability. Infrastructure to safely reprocess everything.

The architecture has been around for a while — Martin Fowler helped popularize event sourcing nearly two decades ago. But most teams ran into the same issue: implementing it well was too complex for everyday use.

That’s the reason behind the Flowcore Platform To make this kind of architecture not just possible, but effortless. Flowcore handles the messy parts. The ingestion, the immutability, the reprocessing, the flow management, the replay. So you can just build. You send an event, define what you want done with it, and replay it whenever you need to improve.",0,3,OAEareMyInitials,2025-04-15 15:55:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jzvfys/event_sourcing_isnt_about_storing_history_its/,0,False,2025-04-15 16:09:47,False,False,2025-04-15 15:55:44,15,Tuesday,995.0,6011,68.06,85,1530,9.8,0,0
