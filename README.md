# Reddit Data Engineering Trends Analysis

## TL;DR: What's Trending on r/dataengineering?

This project analyzes Reddit posts from the `r/dataengineering` subreddit to identify trending topics, key engagement drivers, and hidden patterns in community discussions. It leverages NLP, topic modeling, and statistical visualizations to turn daily posts into actionable insights.

---

## Overview

An automated end-to-end pipeline powered by Apache Airflow that:

1. **Ingests** Reddit posts daily using the Python Reddit API Wrapper.
2. **Stores** the data in Amazon S3 and CSV format.
3. **Cleans** and tokenizes post content.
4. **Extracts features** (word count, sentiment, readability score, etc.).
5. **Applies NLP** using Word2Vec and BERTopic for topic clustering.
6. **Visualizes** key drivers of engagement.
7. **Uploads** all processed outputs and charts locally and to Amazon S3.

## Engagement Patterns (Key Insights)

### When to Post

- Posts around **5 AM UTC** show the **highest average scores**, aligning with early morning U.S. hours.
    ![Average Score by Hour](graphs/avg_score_comments_by_hour.png)
- Despite fewer posts early in the day, engagement is stronger, meaning **less competition** for attention.
    ![Post Frequency by Hour](graphs/post_frequency_by_hour.png)
- **Sunday and Thursday** posts have wider engagement ranges (Scores from posts on Sunday and Thursday have a higher distribution)
    ![Score by Weekday](graphs/avg_score_by_weekday.png)

---

### What to Write in Your Post

- Posts between **600‚Äì700 words** tend to get the highest engagement.

- Shorter posts can go viral too ‚Äî especially concise tips, rants, or job updates.

### Topics That Drive Engagement

![Top 10 Words by Cluster](graphs\word2vec_clusters.png)
- **Cluster 1** (üüß orange in Word2Vec plot) consistently shows the **highest average score**, **highest word count**, and **highest character count**. This suggests that **longer, more detailed posts drive significantly better engagement**.

- Posts in this cluster commonly contain words like **‚Äúworking,‚Äù ‚Äúexperience,‚Äù ‚Äújob,‚Äù anyone,‚Äù ‚Äúcompany,‚Äù and looking**, showing that **career advice, job insights, and personal experiences** might relate most with readers.

- Word clusters with **Databricks, pipelines, Snowflake, Python, AWS, dbt** also yield **higher engagement**.

- Based on the cluster engagement heatmap:

  | Metric              | Cluster 1 Value     | Insight                                 |
  |---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
  | Average Score       | **12.6**            | Highest engagement among clusters        |
  | Average Word Count  | **174.8**           | Longer posts perform better              |
  | Character Count     | **1074.8**          | More detailed posts = higher scores      |
  | Average Sentiment   | **-0.69**           | Slightly neutral/negative but thoughtful |

- This indicates that:
  - **Thoughtful, authentic storytelling** around personal experience gets noticed.
  - **Descriptive posts** with deeper context (vs. shallow questions) tend to outperform.
  - Posts that aren't strongly opinionated or emotional (but have a slightly negative sentiment) tend to do well.

- **This Week** ‚Üí weekly topic strength
    ![Weekly BERTopic Bar Chart](graphs\bertopic_weekly_barchart_example.png)
- **Overall** ‚Üí all-time frequent topics
    ![Overall BERTopic Chart](graphs\bertopic_overall_barchart_example.png)

Key topics:  
- Azure certifications (dp-203)
- Databricks, dbt, Spark
- Airflow orchestration
- Microsoft and cloud tools

### TF-IDF Signals from High vs Low Engagement Posts

- **High-engagement** words:
  `"spark"`, `"pipelines"`, `"airflow"`, `"company"`, `"dbt"`
    ![TF-IDF High vs Low](graphs/tfidf_high_vs_low_difference_comparison.png)

- **Low-engagement** posts often overuse generic terms:
  `"data"`, `"know"`, `"need"`, `"working"`
    ![Low Engagement TF-IDF](graphs/lowest_post_top30_tf-idf_words.png)

- **Logged TF-IDF Ratio** confirms tech-specific vocabulary outperforms filler terms.
    ![Logged Ratio Comparison](graphs/tfidf_high_vs_low_ratio_comparison.png)

### Correlations That Matter

- Score and comments are positively correlated (r=0.55).
- Code or URL presence doesn't necessarily increase score.
- Readability metrics have little effect unless extremely high or low.
